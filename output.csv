1,Disappointing Quality and Durability(Poor quality),"Play Video
 I purchased the this bagpack back in February with high hopes of owning a reliable and durable product. However, my experience with it has been nothing short of disappointing. After only a few months of very limited usage, I noticed several issues that should not have occurred.

Firstly, the bottle holder mesh, which is an essential feature for me, unexpectedly tore apart. I didn't put any excessive weight or strain on it, as I only used it occasionally. Additionally, the zip chain came off, leaving the bag's contents vulnerable and causing inconvenience.

What surprises me the most is that I didn't even use the bag on a daily basis, yet it still encountered numerous problems. I expected better quality and craftsmanship from a brand like American Tourister, known for its reputation and assurance of providing reliable products.

Regrettably, I didn't read any reviews before purchasing this product, and now I understand the importance of doing so. I hope this review serves as a warning to others who might be considering purchasing this item. It simply did not live up to its promises, and I cannot recommend it to anyone."
1,Very Wrost product,Too Small And Quality is Not Ok
3,Image and the real product is slightly different,"Picture and the actual product what i have received is slightly different in term of colours. And quality it seems pretty normal to me it's not that great with that price.
Ifact the front part looks similar to raxine."
2,Not a good quality,Bag did not make it more than a year. My son used this it has ripped in several places
2,Not worth it Literally..,My precious bottle got slipped because there was no side straps for bottle protection and the bag quality is also not good. This will be easily available in 500/- from local Market
3,Quality is not good,Material is like a plastic but the space is nice
1,Poor quality,Not happy with the quality. It does not seems it's American tourister
1,Don't buy this cheap quality product.,Quality wasn't good. Very worst product. Seems like fake one
1,Bag is left site damage,"Damage only one time use
going to mp my brother"
3,Not upto the mark,The front chain has only on chain hook. Have to close chain completely every time.and that compartment also is opening 100% which makes things falling out of it. The material also looks glossy not the premium one.
3,Low quality bag,Quality of bag is not good. Very light. Not suitable for professional use.
2,I think its not a Genuine one...,"I've using this brand since 2012. But at this time am not satisfied with this product quality. Totally the backpack looks cheap quality especially in stitching... After using 1 month some stitches were become damage and also the Print Quality is cheap one...
So please think once again before buying this Tourister Backpack"
3,The outline and inner stitches are not that great.. needs to be even more sturdy,Not sure
1,Not standard design and look,"There is no compartment to keep laptop, so wiered"
3,Packaging was not good,Quality is good but one black spot on the handle.only carrybag use for delivery if they have used box so it would be good for delivery.
3,Not met the expectations,Bad quality
1,Very bad product,The quality of the stuff is very bad
3,Design and lightweight,"Abhi tk return ka payment nhi aaya h hum es pr case kr skte h 23 june ko returns le gya abhi tk received kyo nhi hua esi seva rahi to sbhi ka Amazon pr vishvash nhi rahegaOverall Product was good lightweight good design but..
The quality was not that good as expected from American tourister
Bottle holder was also big
Bag is suitable for 8th-College
Thanks amazon"
1,Too big and Amazon is not arranging the return,The product is too big for a school bag. Also they are not returning the product despite multiple follow ups. Not recommended.
3,Bag cover,They have written that it contains bag cover but bag cover is not their
3,SCHOOL BAG BEST FOR KIDS,Not for laptop or office use
2,Poor substandard quality,Very poor quality. Tore after a month of use. Looks duplicate. Doesn't seem authentic. Do not waste your money.
1,Stitching,Low material quality jip also not comfortable
1,Quality is very Bad, Material used is very Bad and Packing was also not done I would never trust this again and anyone should not buy this
2,Bad product,This print got cracked in just one month totally waste of money
1,Please Dont Buy This Bag .,I bought this bag around 1¬Ω month ago in single month this bag started losing threds and one stripe was totally tore . Then I tried to claim warranty of this bag every store said this bag is 7-8 year old model of which production was stopped years ago thats why they are selling to Amazon flipcart at such minimal price . You can see the bottle holder it's made up of net which was used in old bag new bags of American tourister doesn't give met bottle holder it gives whole cloth. And waterproofing of this bag is worst just some drops of rain üí¶ fell on this and it destroyed my whole books even when I had wore bag raincoat . If there were an option of zero star I would have loved to give it. It's not even worth 300rs. Buy offline bags if you want to buy American tourister. My previously used bag is still in working condition which I'm using for 6 year. üëéüëéüëéüëé

5,Shooting makeup bags,Material is too good . Can useful for shooting makeup bags..
3,Not Worth Buying," Like -
Only Material and Zipper Quality

Dislikes -

Images shown in picture that it's very spacious but If we talk about space after putting 1 laptop , 2 small diaries , 2 book like catalogs it feels like tourist bag.

You can not carry more than this else you will feel that your bag will be torn apart after few minutes if you will carry that much stuff.

Not comfortable for Daily work use and travel as well,

Not easy to use and carry in daily work-life and travel in occasionally way.

Stitching quality somehow makes you feel like that This is gonna torn apart after carrying some extra weight which you will not feel any other backpacks.

My personal experience and recommendations that don't Go with This.

Meanwhile in same budget either go with some branded backpacks or Add some extra bucks in your budget and go with Hammonds Flycatcher Leather Bags."
3,Good one but it's more like a sales bag,The material is fine. But the bag is too big and it's not for college students or office purposes as it is too big and feels like a sales bag.
5,Excellent material to carry all my essentials for my tours and travels.,Same as above title review.
5,Good,NA
3,good material and overall structure but...,"one of it's outer pockets came off because of poor sewing. otherwise it was a good bag, i always carried a lot of weight in it and while it became a bit uncomfortable because of its weight it fared for almost a year which is quite a fair duration of time for all the heft i stored in it. its fabric around the belt joint tore up after 10 months of use."
5,Nice product,V.Nice product
5,"Useful , handy",
4,Good daily use office bag,"Good Sturdy quality and very spacious. Plus with multiple pockets you never miss anything. You can store everything in this bag. Specially electronics and gym clothes.

The quality is very good as well.
Worth the buy"
5,Refreshing to find such a good local brand,"One of my only 2 or 3 reviews in Amazon. Felt compelled to say how good the bag is. So many little thoughful things that are very helpful. And heartwarming to know about their social responsibility and how they employ disadvantaged and donate. And yet manage to create a stunning functional design, craftsmanship and well built product."
4,Premium & Goodlooking,Verry good looking.You will look professional in it. Everyone will ask the name and price of it.
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"Ok, so just got this bag and the first impression is pretty darn good.

I tend to weigh things from an utility prespective.
So it seems spacious.
Lots and pockets to organize stuff. Like that.
The zippers feel well made.
Fine stiching.
Option to convert to bag pack. Nice touch

I got the dark grey colour. Looks good paired with the brown theme.

The fabric feels sturdy, would have to use to understand how well it actually holds up. For the asking price I would say its a fair ROI, if this holds up well.

Thanks fatmug!"
5,"Good product, value for money!","Good product, bigger than expected, good quality, good space management and value for money!"
5,Best Product,"Very good product, where I can accommodate many items with ease. Worth for the money....üôÇ"
4,Good Quality Bag for Office,
5,Too Good,"Met Expectations.

Happy with the product"
4,Good Bag but not waterproof,"This bag is excellent in terms of build quality and space, and it has many great features. However, one downside is that it is not waterproof."
5,Astounding product,"Very nice product love the colour and design very nice,loved it....."
5,Multipurpose,It is multipurpose and easy to transform from sling bag to backpack ... quality is decent and multiple pockets are really useful.
3,"Almost great, some cheap thing destroying the overall value","The bag is good overall, nearly great. Looks wise it's decent, quality wise almost a semi-premium/ good enough...
#...except with a few cheap components that are spoiling it's reputation.
Like One very strikingly cheap part is the 'metallic-like' lock-clip attached to the plastic hooks of the strap. It's not even basic steel like that of a cheap safety pin. This is perhaps some composite material mixed with Aluminium or something else cheap only. It's looks so thin, and weak and looks like it'll break in to easily.
# They might have saved < 50 paise on that component
# This stupidity & cheapness on behalf of some designers/ quality team, in component sourcing is what destroys the whole effort of the brand to build 'premium'/good quality image!
# I'm taking of merely 2 stars for this as a customer. But if i were the quality head/ business manager in that company, would really not let this pass through."
4,Worth Buying @ Rs.1499/-,"Product is well crafted with good quality of material. Rs.1499/- is good price for this product but few things to consider. 1) Lots of Zipper which may be not preferable to everyone 2) Bag feels like too bulky if you only buy to carry laptop because here you can also keep lots of other stuff from books and dairies and file folder or some cloths also. 3) A 15.5 inch laptop is the perfect size for this bag if someone has 13.5 or 14 inch laptop then he or she will feel the bulky size of the bag as I felt.
Lots of cabin, lots of zipper pocket helps you to put all your electronics accessories in one place. I have Laptop, Charger, 2 External Hard Drive, small pouch with memory card - adaptor - card reader - pen drive - stylus, 2 notebook and 1 file folder are well fitted in the bag.

So, quality and price is good. rest is your call."

The bag is really light and you dont feel it on your shoulder and the back muscles. I took this bag to my official trip to delhi as well."
5,Best Laptop Bag," Totally worth the money. Color is bit darker than what is shown in the app but this color is better than what is shown. It has sooo many pockets to carry everything. Plus it can be carried like a briefcase, on one side shoulder and also as a back pack. It has provision for everything. Loved the bag. Only thing i wish it would be made water resistant. But the cloth is very sturdy & will last long"

4,Great Purchase,"Go for it, it's good for quality and it looks really nice,
It is slightly heavy-weight and doesn't look like an office bag."
4,Not that good,The design and the bag meterials are good but the zipper is really bad... I don't know how long it stays.. may be a few months or less... They clearly took advantage of those defects that can be blamed on the customer...
5,Amazing Quality,"Though the bag is little big, but it has to be big else your 15.6/16 inch laptop will not fit.
It has in total 6 pockets outside and 2 huge chains where you can put your all essential in it.
It has even 2 compartments where you can keep your 15.6/16 inch laptop and ipod or 13/14 inch laptop.

4,Good Bag for all use,"As other feedbacks say, this has lots of storage space. Lots of zips, very Stuardy and rugged."
3,Product is OK,"With the price tag the bag should be provided with rain cover atleast, not expecting to be fully waterproof.

And hook quality, stitching quality can be improved massively. Hooks are pure pvc, they'll obviously break at some point. Zip are also not of great quality.

Product looks premium but with rain cover and better zip and hook quality, product will definitely be a big hit I would say."

Just a bigger size. It helps to organize Laptop, Tablet, Mobile, Money, Books, Pens and many more. Best for office use."
4,Surprised it can withstand bulky books and yet look stylish,"I bought this bag for school. My expectation was really low since it clearly didn't look like it was made for 400 pages long maths book üòÖ. The idea was to return it the very first day it arrived if it didn't fit with my school books and stationary but boy was I wrong. The books fit in perfectly, and has so many compartments, this way I can use different compartments for different functions. With every pro there is an opposite con (science joke üòÇ) so there is no place for lunch and snacks, even if you are a small eater you will probably need a lunch bag separately. There is no water compartment, and we can't blame the designer since it was made for a completely different reason, so you will probably need to fit your water bottle in your lunch bag. If you go around these small issues you are buying a perfect bag for school although it wasn't the first idea. I am probably boring you soooo one final thing it is an amazing idea how there is so many way to wear this bag and how you can wear this to your office, school, picnic, etc... you can even use this has a laptop bag. People working in fields such as filmmaker, photographer, etc.. this is perfect for you guys too"

5,Best thing ever bought on amazon,"I am using this bag for almost a year. Only some puller elastic has fallen out . Otherwise my laptop is very secure with this bag, it offers foam on all sides. I even accidentally dropped my bag numerous times while traveling even though nothing happened to the laptop. Very satisfied with this itemü§©"
4,Best buy,"Well designed laptop bag, spacious enough even for a 17in laptop and most importantly its lite in weight."
5,Worth for money,Best color and quality
4,Spacious and big bag," Bag is big and spcacious with many pockets.
Can be used as a travel bag also."

5,Very Nice Product.,Very Nice Product.
5,"Great product, quality and usability","It‚Äôs a very good quality product with many pockets. Also various options with straps. Best part shoulder straps are zipped inside if you don‚Äôt want it hanging and getting hooked accidentally.

Overall worth the price - I recommend this product"
4,Good,Bag is good only down side is its little heavy
3,Not Worth Buying,"Play Video
 Like -
Only Material and Zipper Quality

Dislikes -

Images shown in picture that it's very spacious but If we talk about space after putting 1 laptop , 2 small diaries , 2 book like catalogs it feels like tourist bag.

You can not carry more than this else you will feel that your bag will be torn apart after few minutes if you will carry that much stuff.

Not comfortable for Daily work use and travel as well,

Not easy to use and carry in daily work-life and travel in occasionally way.

Stitching quality somehow makes you feel like that This is gonna torn apart after carrying some extra weight which you will not feel any other backpacks.

My personal experience and recommendations that don't Go with This.

Meanwhile in same budget either go with some branded backpacks or Add some extra bucks in your budget and go with Hammonds Flycatcher Leather Bags."
3,Good one but it's more like a sales bag,The material is fine. But the bag is too big and it's not for college students or office purposes as it is too big and feels like a sales bag.
3,good material and overall structure but...,"one of it's outer pockets came off because of poor sewing. otherwise it was a good bag, i always carried a lot of weight in it and while it became a bit uncomfortable because of its weight it fared for almost a year which is quite a fair duration of time for all the heft i stored in it. its fabric around the belt joint tore up after 10 months of use."
3,Durability,The material used could have been better. The canvas used could have been thicker and the shoulder strap clips are very flimsy. Overall a good bag with lots of pockets
3,"Almost great, some cheap thing destroying the overall value","The bag is good overall, nearly great. Looks wise it's decent, quality wise almost a semi-premium/ good enough...
#...except with a few cheap components that are spoiling it's reputation.
Like One very strikingly cheap part is the 'metallic-like' lock-clip attached to the plastic hooks of the strap. It's not even basic steel like that of a cheap safety pin. This is perhaps some composite material mixed with Aluminium or something else cheap only. It's looks so thin, and weak and looks like it'll break in to easily.
# They might have saved < 50 paise on that component
# This stupidity & cheapness on behalf of some designers/ quality team, in component sourcing is what destroys the whole effort of the brand to build 'premium'/good quality image!
# I'm taking of merely 2 stars for this as a customer. But if i were the quality head/ business manager in that company, would really not let this pass through."
3,Value for money.,"For the price, this product is worth a buy. You can use it for 1 year for sure."
3,Product is OK,"With the price tag the bag should be provided with rain cover atleast, not expecting to be fully waterproof.

And hook quality, stitching quality can be improved massively. Hooks are pure pvc, they'll obviously break at some point. Zip are also not of great quality.

Product looks premium but with rain cover and better zip and hook quality, product will definitely be a big hit I would say."
2,Quality,Quality is not as good as like price.
3,Below Average,Size too big and material quality is not as per mentioned.
2,"Spacious & comfy, could've been studier","The bag is spacious. But the corners/ material could have been thicker to maintain the square shape of bag..Also, the strap hooks are delicate to handle the total weight (when full). Mine couldn't handle the weight of 2 laptops & strap hooks are slipping/ breaking easily."
2,The quality is sad,"The strap hook came out in a week, the quality is not good"
3,Design is good.,"I like the design. Finishing is not that perfect, I mean stitching. Quality of Fabric and chanin is to be analysed while using.
I don't about water resistance. Need to check.
it's worth for Rs.1000"
3,Falls short of expectations,"Everything is fine with this bag except the shoulder strap hooks.
The strap is strong but hooks are a pain.
The company does not give wty for the same, hooks don't last.
I am not the only one who has faced this issue, so it is not a one off."
2,It's is not at all water resistant.Dont believe this bag in rain.Quality good.,It's is not at all water resistant.Dont believe this bag in rain.
3,It looks bulky,
3,HONEST REVIEW,Overall it is good however the zip are a bit cheap feeling and open on their own the front one especially when any weight is placed with them for hanging purposes
1,Side strap clip missing,"I m very disappointed. Being a new product, I actually can't used the side strap rk hand tye bag as on eof the safety clip is missing. Also want to replace but can't as the mrp tag also I hav thrown away. What can b done."
1,Bad color,"The color seen on website is not same in reality. It's too dark grey...almost blackish!
It spoiled the look of the bag hence I returned it. Still awaiting the refund!"
3,User friendly,"Product not user friendly, stitches came off easily. Bag itself is over weight"
3,Not recommended at this price,"This bag is not suitable to carry heavy things like heavy laptops and stuff. Moreover it doesn't have proper waterproofing. During heavy showers water will sip through the inner fabrics.
The bag looses it's shape quite early. Only plus point of this bag is its looks and 3 in one style and lots of separate compartments.

NOT RECOMMEND AT THIS PRICE."

Adding a line after a week's usage. The pin holding the side straps gave away. So overall not a good purchase"
1,Office bag,It send me on my address one more extra time I want to reject the parcel
3,Good Material Quality - recieved 1 broken zipper extension hence 3***,"Play Video
 Expected a better quality of zippers for the price point. However the quality of fabric is excellent. Color is very appealing to eyes. Kudos to Amazon for 1 day delivery."
2,The buckles and connecters quality is pathetic,"Had to return because the connectors and buckles were made of cheap plastic and was coming off if worn.
This bag is a copy of clownfish which i found later and returned this and bought the original one."
3,The main pin got disengaged to hold the long strap in just one flight.,The main pin got disengaged to hold the long shoulder strap in just one flight. Couldnt c arry iyt without the strap coming out again and again. Disappointed on what otherwise seemed a good product.
1,Poor quality,I absolutely loved the look of the bag and the amount of space it had... Sadly that's where it ended for me. Barely 4 days of usage and the zip split... And the bag was not even full .. very disappointed... ordered fr a replacement.. let's see how long that one lasts
1,Very bad quality,Material used inside bag is very low quality.stiching is also very bad. Got torn up on the first day of usage. Total disappointment
2,Not recommended,"I did one trip with the bag with normal things one can take on a two day's journey. Unfortunately the buckles and stitches are not strong enough for the weight of things it can hold. As a result, the stitches at the joint of buckles with the body gave up, making a through and through gap in the main compartment. Somehow completed the journey and returned the product immediately."
1,Wrong colour received twice,"I received wrong colour product, I returned the same and 2nd time as well the same happened. Empty bag is bulky, not for daily use as it's very wide. Straps are not so sturdy. Might work if you are 6ft plus and healthy and if you take your car to office."
3,Good but straps not holding the weight,"Though the product was as expected, the quality of the back pack strap seemed to be poor. The brown strap got separated from the stitch after usage in a week's time."
2,Not a long lasting product,Initially it was a good product in all ways but after the daily use of one month only it's inner fabric started teraing automatical from the stitches. And the most important thing is can't return this product after one month.. So in short it's not good for daily use because of bad stitching quality.
1,Don't buy size u see will no be delivered,"Don't buy size u see will no be delivered , I hv returned it same day"
1,"Extremely Poor backpack strap quality, stiching snapped causing the bag to fall. Laptop damaged.","Play Video
 Very disappointing quality. The backpack straps were stiched onto the body with very thin thread. Thanks to this corner cutting the backpack strap snapped off the bag as I was taking the bag off of my bag, the bag fell and it seems the padding for the laptop compartment was skimped on as well as there was significant damage to my laptop body and display after the fall. Extremely disappointing, please avoid if you plan to use the bag for heavy loads (the total weight of the bag when it snapped was about 7kg).

To the bag's credit, it had good spacing and organization in its compartments and seemed of decent quality as well. It seems they cut corners in only the two most important areas."

3,Ok,"Attract dirt and not easy to wash the cloth is something like that
Dont know what will happen after a full wash"
1,the stitching on the straps is weak and will break,low quality stitching. its been not even a month and the strap stitching is tearing. i will not recommend this product to anyone. dont waste your money
2,Not durable enough,The bag handles are not designed in a proper ways
1,Poor quality product ..Avoid,The bag looks nice in pics but is poor quality. The Buckle broke in one week of usage.
1,Buckle installation faulty,"21/10/2022; bought with lot of expectation after going through the general reviews.

Excited when i saw the product. The material seems durable. Spacy. Also provided 2 ways to carry the bag,and provided space to hide the strap, hence not bulky and quite an ergonomic design.

However, all of this came to halt, when i observed the buckles on the shoulder straps. The left buckle is installed faulty and hence, the strap doesn't stay in position.

This is due to lack of quality check from the sellers side.

We don't pay with faulty currency. Hence kindly be obliged enough to not sell faulty products."
1,Not so happy,The bag seems to be good but was delivered in a dirty state. It is washable so may be that helps.

3,Not as good as imagined,"It's large, cumbersome,and in picture appears better than it is in reality. My son developed shoulder pain within a day of use."
1,Bad design and less safe,Worst product and please don't buy guys it is not at all water proof and safe for laptop if it hit ground. Very fatty with few items. Side ways tag you use it will hit your buns for every step. Very pathetic. This is very good for doctors to carry small medicine to nearest patients checkup. Nothing else. Your laptop is in risk if you use this. Over costly. You get best bag in Dell with 600-900rs with fully waterproof and proper locking system to zip.
2,I am disappointed with the product quality and colour. It shld be under 1000.,Quality is not at all shown in the images. It's overpriced and I am highly disappointed with the clr. Think before you invest your money on this product.

5,A very Decent Student Bag in 450 range.,"The bag is not 31L in size. It's actually near to 22-23L in size. Overall the quality is not bad but you cant expect premium quality at 449/-. The straps are good but one little issue with the strap-clips , I fear they will not last more than a year , they might break if you are carrying heavy stuffs daily. No Bag is water resistant but it can bear slight rain , no issues. I will not recommend it for daily passengeries, but for students who are just carrying 2-3 books and going out once or twice a day it's a great choice. Go for it definately if you get it under 400-450. Otherwise at 500 range get a premium branded 15L bag which will be a better option.
Laptop space is very good, you can definately use it as a laptop bag but beware of the strap-clips (probably after 4-5 months you should change it in a local shop for like 20-30 rs)

Well I am happy using it , no issues.
Hope this can help you to review your choice one more time ü§ùüèª."

5,A very Decent Student Bag in 450 range.,"The bag is not 31L in size. It's actually near to 22-23L in size. Overall the quality is not bad but you cant expect premium quality at 449/-. The straps are good but one little issue with the strap-clips , I fear they will not last more than a year , they might break if you are carrying heavy stuffs daily. No Bag is water resistant but it can bear slight rain , no issues. I will not recommend it for daily passengeries, but for students who are just carrying 2-3 books and going out once or twice a day it's a great choice. Go for it definately if you get it under 400-450. Otherwise at 500 range get a premium branded 15L bag which will be a better option.
Laptop space is very good, you can definately use it as a laptop bag but beware of the strap-clips (probably after 4-5 months you should change it in a local shop for like 20-30 rs)

Well I am happy using it , no issues.
Hope this can help you to review your choice one more time ü§ùüèª."

5,Review of Artic fox Bag,"The Arctic Fox Slope Anti Theft 23 L Backpack in Marble Black has proven to be a game-changer for my daily routine. Its sleek and stylish design caught my eye, but it's the practical features that truly impressed me. With a spacious 23 L capacity, this backpack accommodates all my essentials effortlessly. The anti-theft design adds a layer of security, providing peace of mind during my travels.

One standout feature is the built-in USB charging port, which has become invaluable for staying connected while on the move. The convenience of charging my devices on the fly has made this backpack an essential companion in my day-to-day life. The attention to detail in the craftsmanship is evident, and the durable materials used ensure longevity.

Whether I'm commuting, traveling, or heading to work, the Arctic Fox Slope Backpack not only complements my style with its Marble Black finish but also enhances my overall experience. It's a well-rounded, functional backpack that effortlessly combines aesthetics with practicality, making it a standout choice in the market. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and stylish companion for their daily adventures."

Hope this bag last long too üíÄü§û"
4,Bag review,Liked this bag.Look wise and quality wise it's awesome.
5,Secure and Spacious,"This bag, even though has only one zip compartment for Security reasons, has many pockets inside it to get the job done. Its laptop section is also fine for my 15"" laptop. I frequently use it for intercity travel as well as for my college and I have no complaints about it."
5,Comfortable Backpack,"This is one of the best backpack I ever had. Its way too comfortable when you wear it. You can have a laptop and put some books (according to your work)

It's water resistant but in the back pocket of the bag, there's a rain cover to protect the bag from heavy rain and so, you don't have to bring your bag under the umbrella when it rains.

I wanted the back because the last time, I had other bag and my wallet got stolen but this bag's chain are on the bag and it's nearly not possible for anyone to steal the valuables from the bag.

Worth of a product."
4,Space,"A great product, really happy with it.
1. My 15 inch laptop fits perfectly.
2. The pockets which company has offered are very nice, it depends upon the customers too as to which pockets they want to use it for.
3. You got rain cover with the bag itself, no need to purchase it spereatly.
4. I would recommend not to put anything electronic related items in back pocket of the bag as it might get wet when it's raining.

Although I really loved the product. ü§©"

5,A Practical and Secure Companion for Your Belongings,"I recently purchased the Anti-Thrift Backpack, and I must say it has proven to be a practical and secure companion for my belongings. Here's my comprehensive review of this unique backpack:

Design and Construction:
The Anti-Thrift Backpack features a sleek and modern design that is both visually appealing and functional. The exterior is made from a durable and water-resistant material that effectively protects the contents from the elements. The overall construction feels sturdy and well-built, ensuring longevity with regular use.

Anti-Theft Features:
One of the standout features of this backpack is its anti-theft design. It incorporates various security measures to keep your belongings safe. The main compartment of the backpack is concealed against your back, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access it without your knowledge. Additionally, the zippers are hidden and not easily visible, further deterring potential thieves. These anti-theft features provide peace of mind, especially in crowded or public settings.

Storage Capacity and Organization:
The backpack offers ample storage space, allowing you to carry your essentials and more. It features multiple compartments, including a padded laptop sleeve, a spacious main compartment, and smaller pockets for organizing smaller items like keys, pens, and a smartphone. The laptop sleeve provides excellent protection and can accommodate most standard-sized laptops.

Comfort and Ergonomics:
Comfort is an important factor when it comes to choosing a backpack, and the Anti-Thrift Backpack delivers in this aspect. The adjustable shoulder straps are padded and provide good support, reducing strain on your shoulders and back. The back panel is also padded and breathable, promoting airflow and preventing excessive sweating. However, for extended periods of heavy use, the padding on the shoulder straps could be slightly improved.

Additional Features:
The backpack comes with some additional features that enhance its functionality. It includes a USB charging port on the side, allowing you to conveniently charge your devices on the go. However, please note that you would need to provide your own power bank for this feature to work. The backpack also has a luggage strap on the back, which is useful for attaching it to a suitcase when traveling.

Value for Money:
Considering its overall quality and the added security features, the Anti-Thrift Backpack offers good value for money. While it may be slightly more expensive than regular backpacks, the peace of mind and practicality it provides make it worth the investment, especially for individuals who frequently travel or navigate crowded areas.

Conclusion:
The Anti-Thrift Backpack is an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable and secure backpack. Its anti-theft design, durable construction, ample storage capacity, and additional features make it a practical companion for daily use or travel. With its sleek design and functionality, this backpack is a worthy investment to protect your belongings and keep them organized."

4,Simply awesome.,"The build quality is beyond par for the pricing. It's durable and light weight at the same time. Holds a lot of items and still fits onto your back perfectly with flexible straps. The zippers are made nicely and the bag is totally water resistant except for the back mesh and the shoulder straps. The rain covers works wonderfully but water seeps in at times from the closure. Being a drawstring bag itself, the rain cover makes it easy to carry the bag during rains."

4,Good in this segment,There is no draw string and mask in this bag thats the only con . None the less it is a very good bag for college purpose
4,Great product,The quality is subperb. But just one point to highlight is the glue of plastic wrap that protects the logo. It doesn't wash off quickly. Rest happy with the bag!
3,Overall good product but issue with the power bank point in the bag,"The bag is really good in terms of material used to make which feels premium and durable as well as it is adequately spacious and all the necessary items fit within.

Only Problem i encountered is with the power bank pouch. The wire used inside the pouch feels of low quality as it seems to be not compatible with a fast charging power bank (example: MI power banks).
Also the external port through which the charging cable can be plugged into the phone seems to be of poor quality as the charging cable plugs out even with a slightest movement of the bag."

5,Review of Artic fox Bag,"The Arctic Fox Slope Anti Theft 23 L Backpack in Marble Black has proven to be a game-changer for my daily routine. Its sleek and stylish design caught my eye, but it's the practical features that truly impressed me. With a spacious 23 L capacity, this backpack accommodates all my essentials effortlessly. The anti-theft design adds a layer of security, providing peace of mind during my travels.

One standout feature is the built-in USB charging port, which has become invaluable for staying connected while on the move. The convenience of charging my devices on the fly has made this backpack an essential companion in my day-to-day life. The attention to detail in the craftsmanship is evident, and the durable materials used ensure longevity.

Whether I'm commuting, traveling, or heading to work, the Arctic Fox Slope Backpack not only complements my style with its Marble Black finish but also enhances my overall experience. It's a well-rounded, functional backpack that effortlessly combines aesthetics with practicality, making it a standout choice in the market. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and stylish companion for their daily adventures."

Hope this bag last long too üíÄü§û"
4,Bag review,Liked this bag.Look wise and quality wise it's awesome.
5,Secure and Spacious,"This bag, even though has only one zip compartment for Security reasons, has many pockets inside it to get the job done. Its laptop section is also fine for my 15"" laptop. I frequently use it for intercity travel as well as for my college and I have no complaints about it."
5,Comfortable Backpack,"This is one of the best backpack I ever had. Its way too comfortable when you wear it. You can have a laptop and put some books (according to your work)

It's water resistant but in the back pocket of the bag, there's a rain cover to protect the bag from heavy rain and so, you don't have to bring your bag under the umbrella when it rains.

I wanted the back because the last time, I had other bag and my wallet got stolen but this bag's chain are on the bag and it's nearly not possible for anyone to steal the valuables from the bag.

Worth of a product."
4,Space,"A great product, really happy with it.
1. My 15 inch laptop fits perfectly.
2. The pockets which company has offered are very nice, it depends upon the customers too as to which pockets they want to use it for.
3. You got rain cover with the bag itself, no need to purchase it spereatly.
4. I would recommend not to put anything electronic related items in back pocket of the bag as it might get wet when it's raining.

Although I really loved the product. ü§©"

5,A Practical and Secure Companion for Your Belongings,"I recently purchased the Anti-Thrift Backpack, and I must say it has proven to be a practical and secure companion for my belongings. Here's my comprehensive review of this unique backpack:

Design and Construction:
The Anti-Thrift Backpack features a sleek and modern design that is both visually appealing and functional. The exterior is made from a durable and water-resistant material that effectively protects the contents from the elements. The overall construction feels sturdy and well-built, ensuring longevity with regular use.

Anti-Theft Features:
One of the standout features of this backpack is its anti-theft design. It incorporates various security measures to keep your belongings safe. The main compartment of the backpack is concealed against your back, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access it without your knowledge. Additionally, the zippers are hidden and not easily visible, further deterring potential thieves. These anti-theft features provide peace of mind, especially in crowded or public settings.

Storage Capacity and Organization:
The backpack offers ample storage space, allowing you to carry your essentials and more. It features multiple compartments, including a padded laptop sleeve, a spacious main compartment, and smaller pockets for organizing smaller items like keys, pens, and a smartphone. The laptop sleeve provides excellent protection and can accommodate most standard-sized laptops.

Comfort and Ergonomics:
Comfort is an important factor when it comes to choosing a backpack, and the Anti-Thrift Backpack delivers in this aspect. The adjustable shoulder straps are padded and provide good support, reducing strain on your shoulders and back. The back panel is also padded and breathable, promoting airflow and preventing excessive sweating. However, for extended periods of heavy use, the padding on the shoulder straps could be slightly improved.

Additional Features:
The backpack comes with some additional features that enhance its functionality. It includes a USB charging port on the side, allowing you to conveniently charge your devices on the go. However, please note that you would need to provide your own power bank for this feature to work. The backpack also has a luggage strap on the back, which is useful for attaching it to a suitcase when traveling.

Value for Money:
Considering its overall quality and the added security features, the Anti-Thrift Backpack offers good value for money. While it may be slightly more expensive than regular backpacks, the peace of mind and practicality it provides make it worth the investment, especially for individuals who frequently travel or navigate crowded areas.

Conclusion:
The Anti-Thrift Backpack is an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable and secure backpack. Its anti-theft design, durable construction, ample storage capacity, and additional features make it a practical companion for daily use or travel. With its sleek design and functionality, this backpack is a worthy investment to protect your belongings and keep them organized."

The zippers are made nicely and the bag is totally water resistant except for the back mesh and the shoulder straps. The rain covers works wonderfully but water seeps in at times from the closure. Being a drawstring bag itself, the rain cover makes it easy to carry the bag during rains."

I had a clear check list on purchase of the bag and some of the most important points are
-> good laptop padding for good laptop protection
->waterproof for my daily office rides
->trendy design for weekend getaway bag
-> ample space that can support my laptop, 1 diary, water bottle and 2 pair of dresses

This bag has surprised me by fulfilling all needs . The bag is designed remarkably well with a lot of hidden useful pockets.
3/4 th of the bag can be opened for arranging the contents of the bag.
Luckily it rained today, not a heavy one and found out that bag along with the rain cover provided is well and good for moderate rains as no water seepage has occurred.
Thanks Arctic Fox for giving free Mask and rain cover .
This bag is also a good attention grabber, as most of my colleagues have enquired today itself and where I bought this from.
In my opinion a good value for money product which is packed with features and quality which is lacking in this price range ."

Only Problem i encountered is with the power bank pouch. The wire used inside the pouch feels of low quality as it seems to be not compatible with a fast charging power bank (example: MI power banks).
Also the external port through which the charging cable can be plugged into the phone seems to be of poor quality as the charging cable plugs out even with a slightest movement of the bag."

3,Average,Waise to bag theek hai must buy but iske straps chote hai aur isme 1 compartment hone ke karan app baad me iritate ho sakte hain isme 1 ltr water bottle fit hone me problem hoti hai
3,"Good bag, a little less space.","The bag design is great, it's comfortable to wear as well. It's anti-theft is alright. But when I purchased the bag it came with loose strings out in the stitches because of which the zip wouldn't move. It is really constricted in its space, you cannot place a lot of stuff despite what you may think. It is great for light travel though, the rain cover has a slot in the bag you can keep at all times and is great.
Overall it's a decent purchase as long as you know it isn't for packing too many things. It's comfortable and looks good, is good quality material as well so seems like it'll last real long."

 Stitching is open someplace and threads is not cut well . Material is good quality but finishing is also important"

3,Stitching is not good as brand like safari.,"pros
Bag material quality is really good.
It looks really premium.
Safe for my hp pavilion laptop.
Zippers quality is fine.

Cons
Low quality metal zippers in small pockets.
Threads coming out from stitched area.(hope it will last)
Med kit not provided. (Only a COVID mask
.
.
Conclusion-you should go for this bag (only for lite use) like laptop and gadgets.
I am not sure about its stitching ,hope it will last long .

You don't regret after buying"
3,little satisfied,bag was good although raincover was changed
2,Not As Soon In YT Videos,"Bag is Good But Not What We See In Youtube Videos,

Video Shows They Give MediKit, But in real their is mask, Which is not even seems high quality,

Rain Cover, In Yt you see a rope with it, so you can wear bag on raincover but however now bags don‚Äôt have that, so its hard to carry in that,

Handles seems not much strong,

Its look great, great branding, but they shouldn‚Äôt change what shows in Youtube,

Seems like cost cutting, i was expecting much better but however I won‚Äôt returning, as its seems fine at this cost, but not fully happy"
3,Missing Mask.,"this is a cool backpack. but they didn't include the mask they said they'll include. it was missing from the package. apart from that, it is a pretty nice backpack. but yeah, missing mask and the package wasn't even tampered with. searched every part of the backpack. couldn't find."
2,Poor stitching quality,"Play Video
 Its not even been 3months, but the stitching near the shoulder strap came out. Warranty service is waste. They'll ask you to ship the product to thier office in Bengaluru for them to repair it."

1,Charging port is not working,Quality is good but charging port is not working
3,worth the price but little congested,"Bag is pretty good , especially the padding , waterproofing and good build quality. Don't think i'll even need the rain cover .But zip gets stuck sometimes and i wish it was little more spacious and had another seperate compartment because after my laptop and books there's barely any space left for other things. water bottle holder is too small , doesn't expand much. having foam padding on the back side might have added some comfort.
Overall it's good for college use, can carry about 10 notebooks , a laptop and some accessories, not meant for travelling."
3,IT'S TOO SMALL,OVERALL QUALITY AND OTHER ASPECTS ARE GREAT BUT IT'S TOO SMALL IN SIZE. AND WHEN I TRIED TO RETURN THE PRODUCT THERE WAS NO OPTION AVAILABLE FOR RETURN.
3,Entirely Different.... Experience !,"I liked this bas a lot, and a friend of mine recommended me this bag. But it doesn't feel that worth.
The zipper quality is very bad, and the PowerBank port is not functional.... It's not working.
The space too is very less than expected, hardly 4 books.
The bag is very stiff, Actually discomfortable while it's on the back.

Considering good, better and best...
It is good !"
3,USB port not working.,"I ordered the product for college use and after 2 days I found that USB port was not working. Also I can't replace the product because I was shifting to my college in other state. And when I came to college, I found that my roommate also have same backpack with not working USB port."
3,A bit less spacious then expected,"A bit less spacious, a gaming laptop and 3pieces of garments will tke up all of the space tho chargers cables and other documents stuff can be kept. But it will be tightly arranged"
3,missing!!!!,mask is missing and quality of rain cover in not good.....
3,Brand logo shifted, Actually quality is good for usable but there brand logo shifted so please improve immediately & only rain cover is present there not given any first aid kit.
3,Product review,Slightly good
1,Small size,Very little space in the bag. No use.
3,Nice,Nice looks but got different colour and no mask
3,Good Quality bag but small capacity,The bag quality is good. But the capacity is very low due to the design. Not too convenient to keep and take items often.
1,Material Quality is only Good,"Material Quality is good but every other things are bad like USB Cable used in the bag are very bad.

I am having Super Fast Power Bank but if you connected through the bag USB the charging speed is very very slow and waste of having USB Port in the bag.

There should be more components."
3,Good Bag,It's a good product but quality can be improved. Not sure if this is waterproof or not but good look
1,The item was missing from the bad,The produce was not there in the box
3,Too much wide,Too much wide. The picture is not enough to get a clear idea. Water resistant only when water falls on top of it not when it falls in a water pool or road pothole. Water will enter it in that case. Security features are good as mentioned. But that can be cut easily if the thief has good cutting equipment. Value for money if you are getting it under your 1400. Prices fluctuate on Amazon. Avoid buying at 1999. Not worth 1999.
3,Not enough space for carrying daily essentials to work.,I bought this bag after seeing that they give full rain cover which others dont give. The bag doesnt have that much storage volume. You can't even carry a small cylindrical lunch box along with laptop. Its better to go with more volume bags if you carry other things with laptop.
3,Warranty just for showcasing. They are least bothered about customer satisfaction and retention!,"Got this bag a month ago...looks good...the chargable concept is funny it just transfers the powerbank's charge to your phone, but thats ok what bothered me the most is its been more than 2 weeks since i have applied for a warranty but have not received any reply from them, as asked i submitted my details and the bill but invain. I tried connecting to them but of no help, I wonder if the warranty is just for showcasing."
3,Artic fox,Bag is good but not water proof
1,Anti theft,The anti theft cord is missing
1,Caution: seller will send used products,"Thoroughly check for faults and signs of use. In my case, I found these two tickets in the bag. These tickets were dated just a week before I placed my order. Never buying another product from Artic Fox or this seller again. There is also no seller stamp or sign to register this product for warranty."
1,Poor quality stitches,"Stitches are improper, rain cover is not as i saw in video, please provide that rain cover have a rop with it and also medikit is missing ita not important so (medikit)...
As spending 1500/- you have to maintain all the things. To sustain reputation you have to take care of the quality of your product."
3,Space is very limited because of the thick and sponzy material used to make bag,I put my laptop and doc file which cover around 60% of space if i have to put pair of cloths it would be very difficult as it dosent have sperate compartments.
2,Product quality pretty awesome....stitching Quality issue.,Not as shown in image. Stitching at both side on top of PU leather are not same some loose part may got wrinke soon I have marked on pic attached. Want replacement.
3,Very low space,Material quality is good. But no sufficient space.
3,Medi kit wasn't provided,Quality is enpressive but medi kit wasn't provided with backpack
3,Stylish but uncomfortable,The bag looks nice and stylish but fails somehow as a bag. Something is off with the design that your shoulders hurt after a bit and the space inside isn't great either to carry a lot of stuff. There is a pouch for a bottle but too small for almost any bottle lol.
1,Damage product received,"I received the Laptop backpack, but unfortunately, the laptop strip is torn. This damage is quite disappointing, as it affects the functionality and overall usability of the product. I hope the issue can be resolved promptly to ensure a better customer experience."
3,Drawstring bag not provided,I got normal rain cover. Drawstring bag not provided. That is the only drawback from me. Bag quality is superb.
3,ok type of product,Not as sturdy as I think. But it is ok we are using it
2,Stiching is not proper on one side,One side stiching is not proper and all other is ok
2,Less space,In don't receive medical kit instead of that i got n-95 mask . Don't buy this bag for college or other except for laptop because it is only made for laptop because only 5 notebook üìì fit inside it no space left where i put my books and lunchbox ü§ê
3,Not bad for the money,"The quality is good, water resistance is ok, but they include a rain cover so that covers the issue, not as big as shown in the pictures, definitely not 23 lit, maybe 19lit and that's stretching it."
3,No first aid kit,No first aid kit provided as promised
3,Stitching,Not the best stitching material.
3,Okayish,Didn't like the model or structure of the bag
1,"Less pockets, hard to use","Good product, but very Hard to use and not for traveling, you will miss pockets. Only office to home and office."
2,Not worth,Less space and very difficult to open the zip and less compartments
3,Quality not satisfied,Quality not staisfied

2,Faulty charging port,"The port where you are supposed to plug the USB cable is stitched up as well, thus I am unable to plug my USB cable, making it useless. Apart from that minor problem was the zipper chain at the side is also not working properly. Rest everything seems fine for now. Only reason that I'm not giving this 1 star is that the product material seems good."
2,Bag should have some stretchable material for main compartment.,If Bag should have some stretchable material at both sides of main compartment then it could be completely handy bag in all situations.
2,The zip is not locking after 1 month of usage.,"Play Video

1,USB charging port is not functional.,"The charging port doesn‚Äôt work. Could‚Äôve returned it but I checked after the return period. The laptop 15.6 inch hardly fits. Overall a good bag, if you travel a lot. No of materials you can carry inside this too less. Water bottle hardly fits, needed to buy a small one."
3,The outside port doesn‚Äôt work with ios devices,The bag is of good quality. Later while trying to charge I came to know that the outside port doesn‚Äôt support iphones. Tried to raise a warranty claim but it seems they already knew!
1,"Good Quality Bag, Poor Design and stitching","You can see in the pic that the bag was sewed in a haste and the stitching is not in a straight line.

Quality of the material used is really impressive but the stitching and sewing are not.

The powerbank pocket is so congested that data cable will definitely get damaged when plugged."
