4,Decent for the cost,This bag is decent for 1k. Zips are a bit low quality. The 3rd pocket doesn't have much space. The bottle holder has started to tear after a few weeks. Looks alright and is comfortable enough for daily use though.

4,Bag is good but size is too big for kids. No suitable for primary kids.,Bag is of good quality and it's light weight. But it's too big so if you are looking to buy for junior or primary kids go for a smaller option.

Although look wise it is so so."
4,Nice one,Nice one‚Ä¶ worth for the price!!!!
4,Ideal bag for all purpose use,"Water resistance capability is not so good in other words we can say that it's not a waterproof bag but for travelling its a good choice and is extremely lightweight because of the padded straps the total weight of the things you put inside is reduced.
Tgr capacity of holding things is more than u can even think of.
Its a ideal choice for use in all purpose whether it be school or college going ot it may be for office/travelling purpose."
4,As per description,"Spacious, quality wise seems fine, been 2 days that I am using, no issues till now. Very disappointed with the delivery though. Product was delivered just like that outside the locked door, despite giving instructions to drop the package at the security office.

3,Not the value that we pay,Think that it is not original as quality not good

1,High expectations from American tourister,"I have used american tourister many times even I have backpack, suitcase of this brand only but I puchased it online very first time and this I didn't expected from them. If we are puchasing any product with an offer it doesn't mean that thw quality depends on the money paid."
1,Disappointing Quality and Durability(Poor quality)," I purchased the this bagpack back in February with high hopes of owning a reliable and durable product. However, my experience with it has been nothing short of disappointing. After only a few months of very limited usage, I noticed several issues that should not have occurred.

Firstly, the bottle holder mesh, which is an essential feature for me, unexpectedly tore apart. I didn't put any excessive weight or strain on it, as I only used it occasionally. Additionally, the zip chain came off, leaving the bag's contents vulnerable and causing inconvenience.

What surprises me the most is that I didn't even use the bag on a daily basis, yet it still encountered numerous problems. I expected better quality and craftsmanship from a brand like American Tourister, known for its reputation and assurance of providing reliable products.

Regrettably, I didn't read any reviews before purchasing this product, and now I understand the importance of doing so. I hope this review serves as a warning to others who might be considering purchasing this item. It simply did not live up to its promises, and I cannot recommend it to anyone."

1,Please Dont Buy This Bag .,I bought this bag around 1¬Ω month ago in single month this bag started losing threds and one stripe was totally tore . Then I tried to claim warranty of this bag every store said this bag is 7-8 year old model of which production was stopped years ago thats why they are selling to Amazon flipcart at such minimal price . You can see the bottle holder it's made up of net which was used in old bag new bags of American tourister doesn't give met bottle holder it gives whole cloth. And waterproofing of this bag is worst just some drops of rain üí¶ fell on this and it destroyed my whole books even when I had wore bag raincoat . If there were an option of zero star I would have loved to give it. It's not even worth 300rs. Buy offline bags if you want to buy American tourister. My previously used bag is still in working condition which I'm using for 6 year. üëéüëéüëéüëé

1,Duplicate or low quality products are sold on Amazon,"Initially the bag was very good. But with the passage of time and continuous usage, the bottom of the bag started deteriorating. And after 1 year and 2 months it has started tearing off. On the other hand my son is using school bag of Skybags bought from Big Bazaar and it's still in good condition despite of rough usage which usually kids do.

After comparing both the bags I arrived on the conclusion that either the bags which are being sold on Amazon are duplicate products or are of low quality which are specially manufactured for selling on eCommerce websites.

This is not the only case. I have arrived on this conclusion after 3-4 years of experience, as within this period I have purchased handbags of Lavie, Caprese etc. All the bags started deteriorating after passage of one year."

1,Just Okay!,"@999/- the bag seems okay for the price. Cloth quality is cheap and very thin. Stitching is okay. Under heavy weight the bag will surely tear off. Not usable on a longer run. Its made to carry very light material - maybe just for clothes. Books, laptop, chargers, nothing of that sort should be carried in it due to flimsy tearable build quality. Not recommended as a school bag at all. Stay away! Look elsewhere."

1,Cheap and degraded quality product,"I received a torn and damaged bag.
The entire part over the front zipline was in a dilapidated condition although it came in tags.
The bag is light but quality is pretty cheap.
This is getting a frequent thing now for Amazon where they seems least bothered to take any action against Sellers who dupe consumers."
1,Bad üëé,Dislike
1,Very good product,Very nice amsome product nice I request u to make fast delivery.
1,Stiches came out within 40 days,"The stiches came out within 40 days. What is the point in paying premium for such bad quality?

Request Amazon to arrange for return (as per the description there is one year warranty on the product)! The return window closes 14 days from the date of delivery. Not sure whether replacement will be provided. Be careful while buying this product."
1,Poor quality product!,"American Tourister is encashing their brand image to sell poor quality products online. A tear has developed in the bag. I can clearly see that it is because of the poor material that was used for the ""bottom base"" of the bag. I
have used the bag moderately for 3-4 months with approx 2 kgs of weight in it (no sharp edges, mostly water bottle and 1-2 notebooks). I doubt that, if the same bag was used by children to carry their school books, it wouldn't be difficult to assume that it could last even a month. Also American Tourister's customer support is not responsive, they don't even bother to reply to e-mails.

Update: American Tourister did respond in the second attempt and agreed to replace the item. However it's actually a greater headache to go to the service center and have the bag replaced than to buy a new bags keeping the COVID in mind."
1,Poor Quality. Didn't expected this from this brand,Purchased this product on December 2nd and bottle holder on both sides teared within 2 months. American Tourister is a reputed brand and didn't expected this pathetic quality.My kid cannot carry waterbottle anymore and bag become useless. Please avoid buying this specific model.

 Like -
Only Material and Zipper Quality

Dislikes -

Images shown in picture that it's very spacious but If we talk about space after putting 1 laptop , 2 small diaries , 2 book like catalogs it feels like tourist bag.

You can not carry more than this else you will feel that your bag will be torn apart after few minutes if you will carry that much stuff.

Not comfortable for Daily work use and travel as well,

Not easy to use and carry in daily work-life and travel in occasionally way.

Stitching quality somehow makes you feel like that This is gonna torn apart after carrying some extra weight which you will not feel any other backpacks.

My personal experience and recommendations that don't Go with This.

Meanwhile in same budget either go with some branded backpacks or Add some extra bucks in your budget and go with Hammonds Flycatcher Leather Bags."
3,Good one but it's more like a sales bag,The material is fine. But the bag is too big and it's not for college students or office purposes as it is too big and feels like a sales bag.
5,Excellent material to carry all my essentials for my tours and travels.,Same as above title review.
5,Good,NA
3,good material and overall structure but...,"one of it's outer pockets came off because of poor sewing. otherwise it was a good bag, i always carried a lot of weight in it and while it became a bit uncomfortable because of its weight it fared for almost a year which is quite a fair duration of time for all the heft i stored in it. its fabric around the belt joint tore up after 10 months of use."

The quality is very good as well.
Worth the buy"
5,Refreshing to find such a good local brand,"One of my only 2 or 3 reviews in Amazon. Felt compelled to say how good the bag is. So many little thoughful things that are very helpful. And heartwarming to know about their social responsibility and how they employ disadvantaged and donate. And yet manage to create a stunning functional design, craftsmanship and well built product."
4,Good looking stylish beg,Good looking beg with multiple pockets.
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"Ok, so just got this bag and the first impression is pretty darn good.

I tend to weigh things from an utility prespective.
So it seems spacious.
Lots and pockets to organize stuff. Like that.
The zippers feel well made.
Fine stiching.
Option to convert to bag pack. Nice touch

I got the dark grey colour. Looks good paired with the brown theme.

The fabric feels sturdy, would have to use to understand how well it actually holds up. For the asking price I would say its a fair ROI, if this holds up well.

Thanks fatmug!"

5,Astounding product,"Very nice product love the colour and design very nice,loved it....."
5,Multipurpose,It is multipurpose and easy to transform from sling bag to backpack ... quality is decent and multiple pockets are really useful.
4,Premium & Goodlooking,Verry good looking.You will look professional in it. Everyone will ask the name and price of it.
3,"Almost great, some cheap thing destroying the overall value","The bag is good overall, nearly great. Looks wise it's decent, quality wise almost a semi-premium/ good enough...
#...except with a few cheap components that are spoiling it's reputation.
Like One very strikingly cheap part is the 'metallic-like' lock-clip attached to the plastic hooks of the strap. It's not even basic steel like that of a cheap safety pin. This is perhaps some composite material mixed with Aluminium or something else cheap only. It's looks so thin, and weak and looks like it'll break in to easily.
# They might have saved < 50 paise on that component
# This stupidity & cheapness on behalf of some designers/ quality team, in component sourcing is what destroys the whole effort of the brand to build 'premium'/good quality image!
# I'm taking of merely 2 stars for this as a customer. But if i were the quality head/ business manager in that company, would really not let this pass through."
4,Worth Buying @ Rs.1499/-,"Product is well crafted with good quality of material. Rs.1499/- is good price for this product but few things to consider. 1) Lots of Zipper which may be not preferable to everyone 2) Bag feels like too bulky if you only buy to carry laptop because here you can also keep lots of other stuff from books and dairies and file folder or some cloths also. 3) A 15.5 inch laptop is the perfect size for this bag if someone has 13.5 or 14 inch laptop then he or she will feel the bulky size of the bag as I felt.
Lots of cabin, lots of zipper pocket helps you to put all your electronics accessories in one place. I have Laptop, Charger, 2 External Hard Drive, small pouch with memory card - adaptor - card reader - pen drive - stylus, 2 notebook and 1 file folder are well fitted in the bag.

So, quality and price is good. rest is your call."

Other manufactures in the segment are looting people a lot."

5,Best Laptop Bag," Totally worth the money. Color is bit darker than what is shown in the app but this color is better than what is shown. It has sooo many pockets to carry everything. Plus it can be carried like a briefcase, on one side shoulder and also as a back pack. It has provision for everything. Loved the bag. Only thing i wish it would be made water resistant. But the cloth is very sturdy & will last long"
5,worth buying,"Good design, material and finishing. We get enough compartments for everything. Nice colour."
4,Great Purchase,"Go for it, it's good for quality and it looks really nice,
It is slightly heavy-weight and doesn't look like an office bag."
4,Not that good,The design and the bag meterials are good but the zipper is really bad... I don't know how long it stays.. may be a few months or less... They clearly took advantage of those defects that can be blamed on the customer...
5,Amazing Quality,"Though the bag is little big, but it has to be big else your 15.6/16 inch laptop will not fit.
It has in total 6 pockets outside and 2 huge chains where you can put your all essential in it.
It has even 2 compartments where you can keep your 15.6/16 inch laptop and ipod or 13/14 inch laptop.
100% recommend"

5,Its was very nice product I liked it thanks, Iam using for my college use nd to carry my Laptop early it was very difficult for me to carry my college bag with my laptop I was looking for it thank you
4,Good Bag for all use,"As other feedbacks say, this has lots of storage space. Lots of zips, very Stuardy and rugged."
3,Product is OK,"With the price tag the bag should be provided with rain cover atleast, not expecting to be fully waterproof.

And hook quality, stitching quality can be improved massively. Hooks are pure pvc, they'll obviously break at some point. Zip are also not of great quality.

Product looks premium but with rain cover and better zip and hook quality, product will definitely be a big hit I would say."

5,Best for office use.,"Good Quality. Fully useful.
Just a bigger size. It helps to organize Laptop, Tablet, Mobile, Money, Books, Pens and many more. Best for office use."
4,Surprised it can withstand bulky books and yet look stylish,"I bought this bag for school. My expectation was really low since it clearly didn't look like it was made for 400 pages long maths book üòÖ. The idea was to return it the very first day it arrived if it didn't fit with my school books and stationary but boy was I wrong. The books fit in perfectly, and has so many compartments, this way I can use different compartments for different functions. With every pro there is an opposite con (science joke üòÇ) so there is no place for lunch and snacks, even if you are a small eater you will probably need a lunch bag separately. There is no water compartment, and we can't blame the designer since it was made for a completely different reason, so you will probably need to fit your water bottle in your lunch bag. If you go around these small issues you are buying a perfect bag for school although it wasn't the first idea. I am probably boring you soooo one final thing it is an amazing idea how there is so many way to wear this bag and how you can wear this to your office, school, picnic, etc... you can even use this has a laptop bag. People working in fields such as filmmaker, photographer, etc.. this is perfect for you guys too"

The fabric feels sturdy, would have to use to understand how well it actually holds up. For the asking price I would say its a fair ROI, if this holds up well.

Thanks fatmug!"

5,Best Laptop Bag," Totally worth the money. Color is bit darker than what is shown in the app but this color is better than what is shown. It has sooo many pockets to carry everything.

But the cloth is very sturdy & will last long"
5,worth buying,"Good design, material and finishing. We get enough compartments for everything. Nice colour."

Lot of space - the pace is just more than enough for a day pack
Lot of pockets- Amazing for organising ..has so many pockets to keep different things
Price- You will not find any other bag with so many utilities for the same price

Cons- not much but would appreciate if they come up with some more colors

I am going to buy this bag only now on...as it suits the best for office/ daily backpack..this is the best format"

5,Extraordinary Product,I have been looking for one multi-utility bag for my laptop and this bag ticks all right boxes. Quality and Design both are Top Notch
5,Value for money,"One of the finest bag
I just loved the cushioning for laptop sleeve"
4,Good product at good price.,Best for office use
4,Very good quality,"Very good quality product, but the dimensions of the is not that comfortable when you wear it as a shoulder bag suggest to make the cushions and bit better"
4,"Good Quality, but the bag is slightly heavy","Bag is very good and appealing. It has many pouches to store stuff and the laptop section is segregated with pouches and slides suitable for storing laptop/tablets. But the bug is slightly heavier, may be due to good quality material."
4,Bulky,I expected not a bulky bag.
4,Good quality but different color,"Good quality, but it's actually a dark Gray, not light Gray as shown in picture"
4,Nice for daily office and college use..,

Worth the buy"
4,Good looking stylish beg,Good looking beg with multiple pockets.
4,Good Bag but not waterproof,"This bag is excellent in terms of build quality and space, and it has many great features. However, one downside is that it is not waterproof."
4,Premium & Goodlooking,Verry good looking.You will look professional in it. Everyone will ask the name and price of it.
4,Worth Buying @ Rs.1499/-,"Product is well crafted with good quality of material. Rs.1499/- is good price for this product but few things to consider. 1) Lots of Zipper which may be not preferable to everyone 2) Bag feels like too bulky if you only buy to carry laptop because here you can also keep lots of other stuff from books and dairies and file folder or some cloths also. 3) A 15.5 inch laptop is the perfect size for this bag if someone has 13.5 or 14 inch laptop then he or she will feel the bulky size of the bag as I felt.
Lots of cabin, lots of zipper pocket helps you to put all your electronics accessories in one place. I have Laptop, Charger, 2 External Hard Drive, small pouch with memory card - adaptor - card reader - pen drive - stylus, 2 notebook and 1 file folder are well fitted in the bag.

So, quality and price is good. rest is your call."
4,Good Quality Bag for Office,

4,Worth for money,"It good for frequently traveller, we can carry number of items in this. Good space and holders."
4,Great Purchase,"Go for it, it's good for quality and it looks really nice,
It is slightly heavy-weight and doesn't look like an office bag."
4,Not that good,The design and the bag meterials are good but the zipper is really bad... I don't know how long it stays.. may be a few months or less... They clearly took advantage of those defects that can be blamed on the customer...
4,Good Bag for all use,"As other feedbacks say, this has lots of storage space. Lots of zips, very Stuardy and rugged."
4,Good stylish bag,Good quality
4,So good, One of the best bag in under 1600 rupees. Quality is very good.
4,Surprised it can withstand bulky books and yet look stylish,"I bought this bag for school. My expectation was really low since it clearly didn't look like it was made for 400 pages long maths book üòÖ. The idea was to return it the very first day it arrived if it didn't fit with my school books and stationary but boy was I wrong. The books fit in perfectly, and has so many compartments, this way I can use different compartments for different functions. With every pro there is an opposite con (science joke üòÇ) so there is no place for lunch and snacks, even if you are a small eater you will probably need a lunch bag separately. There is no water compartment, and we can't blame the designer since it was made for a completely different reason, so you will probably need to fit your water bottle in your lunch bag. If you go around these small issues you are buying a perfect bag for school although it wasn't the first idea. I am probably boring you soooo one final thing it is an amazing idea how there is so many way to wear this bag and how you can wear this to your office, school, picnic, etc... you can even use this has a laptop bag. People working in fields such as filmmaker, photographer, etc.. this is perfect for you guys too"
4,Best buy,"Well designed laptop bag, spacious enough even for a 17in laptop and most importantly its lite in weight."
4,Spacious and big bag,"Play Video
 Bag is big and spcacious with many pockets.
Can be used as a travel bag also."
4,Good,Bag is good only down side is its little heavy
4,Decent convertible bag at the price,"The number of different compartments make usability much better. The laptop cushioning is good with added storage for tablet and another compartment to keep charger, notebook etc.

This can be used as a daily commuter to work. My only issue with this was that the shoulder straps for converting it to a backpack were very loose and I had to get the click attachments refitted from outside."
4,Good,Good product
4,Space,"Like- design and space. It has multiple compartments to keep things.
Dislike- I tend to forget, which place I kept what.
Jokes aside, the quality of fabric is ok types, not very superior."
4,Just go for it‚Ä¶ Worth buying,Its a multi purpose bag‚Ä¶ Come on stop thinking and buy it‚Ä¶ Material is tough too
4,Worth,Plastic of Adjustable strap need in good material
4,"Smart, Spacious, Convertible","Great product for people who like form and function, both. Looks smart on one shoulder like a messenger bag, smarter on both shoulders like a backpack that opens from the side! Inconvenient but cool! Has many compartments for your multiple utilities.

Looks bulky even with few items inside and has a considerable dead weight, hence taking away 1-star from my review! But get ready to be asked by everyone - ‚Äúwhere did you buy this smart bag from!?‚Äù :)"

 Good product. Easy to covert as backpack also."
4,Good quality zip and very spacious,"The bag quality is really good, much better than I hoped.

4,Good bag,"Color and weight does not match the one displayed on the advertisement. But it is a good, strong, and sturdy bag. Lots of space for laptop, accessories, and other office stuff. Recommended for people who carry around a lot of things to office."
4,Value for money,"It's very good, material and the quality is great. Very thoughtfully made. Very spacious also. Over all great product which can carry laptop nd clothes for few days as well."
4,Good for the Price,"The Bag is good for the money.
The pros: 1. Lots of pockets to keep all your things. The 2. You can put a 15"" laptop along with two steel water bottles (one 500ml another 1 litre) with phone and laptop charger wallet pen etc. Space wise this bag is a treat.
Cons:1. The strap for hanging the bag on shoulders has plastic loops as shown in one of my pictures. From my experience this will break over the period of time. I missed this while purchasing the bag.
The material for the bag looks a little cheap. If the bag survives 2 years I will be happy but I feel the interal cloths for partition in the bag won't survive long."
4,Really Great product,This bag is really awesome and budgeted I liked it alot... quality and compartment as both good as well
4,Product is Good Quality.,It's used as short trip bag for 2 day traveling or used as backpack whenever required. Lots of pockets for small stuf You can also put laptop inside. Value for money.

 Like -
Only Material and Zipper Quality

Dislikes -

Images shown in picture that it's very spacious but If we talk about space after putting 1 laptop , 2 small diaries , 2 book like catalogs it feels like tourist bag.

You can not carry more than this else you will feel that your bag will be torn apart after few minutes if you will carry that much stuff.

Not comfortable for Daily work use and travel as well,

Not easy to use and carry in daily work-life and travel in occasionally way.

Stitching quality somehow makes you feel like that This is gonna torn apart after carrying some extra weight which you will not feel any other backpacks.

My personal experience and recommendations that don't Go with This.

Meanwhile in same budget either go with some branded backpacks or Add some extra bucks in your budget and go with Hammonds Flycatcher Leather Bags."
3,Good one but it's more like a sales bag,The material is fine. But the bag is too big and it's not for college students or office purposes as it is too big and feels like a sales bag.
3,good material and overall structure but...,"one of it's outer pockets came off because of poor sewing. otherwise it was a good bag, i always carried a lot of weight in it and while it became a bit uncomfortable because of its weight it fared for almost a year which is quite a fair duration of time for all the heft i stored in it. its fabric around the belt joint tore up after 10 months of use."
3,Durability,The material used could have been better. The canvas used could have been thicker and the shoulder strap clips are very flimsy. Overall a good bag with lots of pockets
3,"Almost great, some cheap thing destroying the overall value","The bag is good overall, nearly great. Looks wise it's decent, quality wise almost a semi-premium/ good enough...
#...except with a few cheap components that are spoiling it's reputation.
Like One very strikingly cheap part is the 'metallic-like' lock-clip attached to the plastic hooks of the strap. It's not even basic steel like that of a cheap safety pin. This is perhaps some composite material mixed with Aluminium or something else cheap only. It's looks so thin, and weak and looks like it'll break in to easily.
# They might have saved < 50 paise on that component
# This stupidity & cheapness on behalf of some designers/ quality team, in component sourcing is what destroys the whole effort of the brand to build 'premium'/good quality image!
# I'm taking of merely 2 stars for this as a customer. But if i were the quality head/ business manager in that company, would really not let this pass through."
3,Value for money.,"For the price, this product is worth a buy. You can use it for 1 year for sure."
3,Product is OK,"With the price tag the bag should be provided with rain cover atleast, not expecting to be fully waterproof.

And hook quality, stitching quality can be improved massively. Hooks are pure pvc, they'll obviously break at some point. Zip are also not of great quality.

Product looks premium but with rain cover and better zip and hook quality, product will definitely be a big hit I would say."
3,Below Average,Size too big and material quality is not as per mentioned.
3,Design is good.,"I like the design. Finishing is not that perfect, I mean stitching. Quality of Fabric and chanin is to be analysed while using.
I don't about water resistance. Need to check.
it's worth for Rs.1000"
3,Falls short of expectations,"Everything is fine with this bag except the shoulder strap hooks.
The strap is strong but hooks are a pain.
The company does not give wty for the same, hooks don't last.
I am not the only one who has faced this issue, so it is not a one off."
3,HONEST REVIEW,Overall it is good however the zip are a bit cheap feeling and open on their own the front one especially when any weight is placed with them for hanging purposes
3,It looks bulky,
3,User friendly,"Product not user friendly, stitches came off easily. Bag itself is over weight"
3,Not recommended at this price,"This bag is not suitable to carry heavy things like heavy laptops and stuff. Moreover it doesn't have proper waterproofing. During heavy showers water will sip through the inner fabrics.
The bag looses it's shape quite early. Only plus point of this bag is its looks and 3 in one style and lots of separate compartments.

NOT RECOMMEND AT THIS PRICE."
3,The chains are not fixed properly., The product haven‚Äôt used yet and chain is defective
3,Good,"Quality is good. But it's 16.5 inch!! Looks bulky and I'm not sure if this is the size I needed. Anyways if your fine with the size, it's a good buy."

3,Ok type,Not as attractive as shown
3,Good Quality,Good quality product but big in size. Not for daily use.

2,"Spacious & comfy, could've been studier","The bag is spacious. But the corners/ material could have been thicker to maintain the square shape of bag..Also, the strap hooks are delicate to handle the total weight (when full). Mine couldn't handle the weight of 2 laptops & strap hooks are slipping/ breaking easily."
2,The quality is sad,"The strap hook came out in a week, the quality is not good"

2,For a messenger bag its too wide,For a messenger bag its too wide
2,The buckles and connecters quality is pathetic,"Had to return because the connectors and buckles were made of cheap plastic and was coming off if worn.
This bag is a copy of clownfish which i found later and returned this and bought the original one."
2,Not recommended,"I did one trip with the bag with normal things one can take on a two day's journey. Unfortunately the buckles and stitches are not strong enough for the weight of things it can hold. As a result, the stitches at the joint of buckles with the body gave up, making a through and through gap in the main compartment. Somehow completed the journey and returned the product immediately."
2,Not a long lasting product,Initially it was a good product in all ways but after the daily use of one month only it's inner fabric started teraing automatical from the stitches. And the most important thing is can't return this product after one month.. So in short it's not good for daily use because of bad stitching quality.
2,Not durable enough,The bag handles are not designed in a proper ways

1,Side strap clip missing,"I m very disappointed. Being a new product, I actually can't used the side strap rk hand tye bag as on eof the safety clip is missing. Also want to replace but can't as the mrp tag also I hav thrown away. What can b done."
1,Bad color,"The color seen on website is not same in reality. It's too dark grey...almost blackish!
It spoiled the look of the bag hence I returned it. Still awaiting the refund!"

1,Office bag,It send me on my address one more extra time I want to reject the parcel
1,Poor quality,I absolutely loved the look of the bag and the amount of space it had... Sadly that's where it ended for me. Barely 4 days of usage and the zip split... And the bag was not even full .. very disappointed... ordered fr a replacement.. let's see how long that one lasts
1,Very bad quality,Material used inside bag is very low quality.stiching is also very bad. Got torn up on the first day of usage. Total disappointment
1,Wrong colour received twice,"I received wrong colour product, I returned the same and 2nd time as well the same happened. Empty bag is bulky, not for daily use as it's very wide. Straps are not so sturdy. Might work if you are 6ft plus and healthy and if you take your car to office."
1,Don't buy size u see will no be delivered,"Don't buy size u see will no be delivered , I hv returned it same day"
1,"Extremely Poor backpack strap quality, stiching snapped causing the bag to fall. Laptop damaged."," Very disappointing quality. The backpack straps were stiched onto the body with very thin thread. Thanks to this corner cutting the backpack strap snapped off the bag as I was taking the bag off of my bag, the bag fell and it seems the padding for the laptop compartment was skimped on as well as there was significant damage to my laptop body and display after the fall. Extremely disappointing, please avoid if you plan to use the bag for heavy loads (the total weight of the bag when it snapped was about 7kg).

To the bag's credit, it had good spacing and organization in its compartments and seemed of decent quality as well. It seems they cut corners in only the two most important areas."

1,"3rd class product ,please don't order","I have used this bag for only 3 days and within 3 days it's chain got damage and lock of Handel also get damage . I have iniciated for refund but picking person not yet come ,it's 7 days now . Don't know what to do .."
1,the stitching on the straps is weak and will break,low quality stitching. its been not even a month and the strap stitching is tearing. i will not recommend this product to anyone. dont waste your money
1,Buckle installation faulty,"21/10/2022; bought with lot of expectation after going through the general reviews.

Excited when i saw the product. The material seems durable. Spacy. Also provided 2 ways to carry the bag,and provided space to hide the strap, hence not bulky and quite an ergonomic design.

However, all of this came to halt, when i observed the buckles on the shoulder straps. The left buckle is installed faulty and hence, the strap doesn't stay in position.

This is due to lack of quality check from the sellers side.

We don't pay with faulty currency. Hence kindly be obliged enough to not sell faulty products."
1,Not so happy,The bag seems to be good but was delivered in a dirty state. It is washable so may be that helps.
1,Unsatisfactory,Colour didn't match
1,Poor quality product ..Avoid,The bag looks nice in pics but is poor quality. The Buckle broke in one week of usage.
1,Dissatisfied with quality,"Even though the bag has features, but the bag is not durable. It's not even two months, but one side arm has broken."
1,Bad design and less safe,Worst product and please don't buy guys it is not at all water proof and safe for laptop if it hit ground. Very fatty with few items. Side ways tag you use it will hit your buns for every step. Very pathetic. This is very good for doctors to carry small medicine to nearest patients checkup. Nothing else. Your laptop is in risk if you use this. Over costly. You get best bag in Dell with 600-900rs with fully waterproof and proper locking system to zip.
1,Too big,This is for a 20 inch laptop. The bag is too big and bulky.
1,Bag delivered with missing string, Bag was ordered as we need to travel and today we have received the bag without the side string..unfortunately we don't have time to replace or return.
1,Bag is oversized and return not getting processed,Bag is oversized and doesn‚Äôt suit for daily use. I requested for return and refund on the same date of delivery (19//23). Till now it is not collected.
1,Cheap shoulder strap - unreliable,Overall product quality looked good initially. After a weeks use the shoulder strap just broke and fell down damaging my laptop. Cheap pin was used at joining. I would advise shoppers to avoid.
1,Very poor stich quality,"Even though the bag stick quality looks good, wehadto return because of the very poor stich quality and got torn on just 2nd day. Without that I don't understand the use of the bag"
1,Not for everyday use.,"Pros:The bag got many pockets.
Cons:Too heavy."
1,Not comfortable for daily routine.,"Bag is not comfortable for daily routine. I wanted to return but unfortunately missed return dates. Bag is not in use ,using an alternative."
1,Sling strap missing,"This product had no sling belt while delivery. After raising replacement within one week after purchase, still I'm yet to receive the bag."
1,Not durable,I am writing this after 5 months usage. The handle came out off stitching
1,Straps tear easily,The bag is very spacious. The only problem is that the brown straps that attach like a backpack tore within two weeks. They couldn‚Äôt take the weight. Very disappointed!
1,Received used shabby bag,Bag in shabby condition put for replacement hope I'll get new product. Dear Fatmug kindly look into this issue.

5,A very Decent Student Bag in 450 range.,"The bag is not 31L in size. It's actually near to 22-23L in size. Overall the quality is not bad but you cant expect premium quality at 449/-. The straps are good but one little issue with the strap-clips , I fear they will not last more than a year , they might break if you are carrying heavy stuffs daily. No Bag is water resistant but it can bear slight rain , no issues. I will not recommend it for daily passengeries, but for students who are just carrying 2-3 books and going out once or twice a day it's a great choice. Go for it definately if you get it under 400-450. Otherwise at 500 range get a premium branded 15L bag which will be a better option.
Laptop space is very good, you can definately use it as a laptop bag but beware of the strap-clips (probably after 4-5 months you should change it in a local shop for like 20-30 rs)

Well I am happy using it , no issues.
Hope this can help you to review your choice one more time ü§ùüèª."

5,Review of Artic fox Bag,"The Arctic Fox Slope Anti Theft 23 L Backpack in Marble Black has proven to be a game-changer for my daily routine. Its sleek and stylish design caught my eye, but it's the practical features that truly impressed me. With a spacious 23 L capacity, this backpack accommodates all my essentials effortlessly. The anti-theft design adds a layer of security, providing peace of mind during my travels.

One standout feature is the built-in USB charging port, which has become invaluable for staying connected while on the move. The convenience of charging my devices on the fly has made this backpack an essential companion in my day-to-day life. The attention to detail in the craftsmanship is evident, and the durable materials used ensure longevity.

Whether I'm commuting, traveling, or heading to work, the Arctic Fox Slope Backpack not only complements my style with its Marble Black finish but also enhances my overall experience. It's a well-rounded, functional backpack that effortlessly combines aesthetics with practicality, making it a standout choice in the market.

5,Secure and Spacious,"This bag, even though has only one zip compartment for Security reasons, has many pockets inside it to get the job done. Its laptop section is also fine for my 15"" laptop. I frequently use it for intercity travel as well as for my college and I have no complaints about it."
4,Worthy,It's worth buying..
5,Bright color and super quality,"Best bag for carrying your laptop, cushion for your back is okish, material is best for this price point"
5,Comfortable Backpack,"This is one of the best backpack I ever had. Its way too comfortable when you wear it. You can have a laptop and put some books (according to your work)

It's water resistant but in the back pocket of the bag, there's a rain cover to protect the bag from heavy rain and so, you don't have to bring your bag under the umbrella when it rains.

I wanted the back because the last time, I had other bag and my wallet got stolen but this bag's chain are on the bag and it's nearly not possible for anyone to steal the valuables from the bag.

Worth of a product."
4,Space,"A great product, really happy with it.
1. My 15 inch laptop fits perfectly.
2. The pockets which company has offered are very nice, it depends upon the customers too as to which pockets they want to use it for.
3. You got rain cover with the bag itself, no need to purchase it spereatly.
4. I would recommend not to put anything electronic related items in back pocket of the bag as it might get wet when it's raining.

Although I really loved the product. ü§©"

5,A Practical and Secure Companion for Your Belongings,"I recently purchased the Anti-Thrift Backpack, and I must say it has proven to be a practical and secure companion for my belongings. Here's my comprehensive review of this unique backpack:

Design and Construction:
The Anti-Thrift Backpack features a sleek and modern design that is both visually appealing and functional. The exterior is made from a durable and water-resistant material that effectively protects the contents from the elements. The overall construction feels sturdy and well-built, ensuring longevity with regular use.

Anti-Theft Features:
One of the standout features of this backpack is its anti-theft design. It incorporates various security measures to keep your belongings safe. The main compartment of the backpack is concealed against your back, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access it without your knowledge. Additionally, the zippers are hidden and not easily visible, further deterring potential thieves. These anti-theft features provide peace of mind, especially in crowded or public settings.

Storage Capacity and Organization:
The backpack offers ample storage space, allowing you to carry your essentials and more. It features multiple compartments, including a padded laptop sleeve, a spacious main compartment, and smaller pockets for organizing smaller items like keys, pens, and a smartphone. The laptop sleeve provides excellent protection and can accommodate most standard-sized laptops.

Comfort and Ergonomics:
Comfort is an important factor when it comes to choosing a backpack, and the Anti-Thrift Backpack delivers in this aspect. The adjustable shoulder straps are padded and provide good support, reducing strain on your shoulders and back. The back panel is also padded and breathable, promoting airflow and preventing excessive sweating. However, for extended periods of heavy use, the padding on the shoulder straps could be slightly improved.

Additional Features:
The backpack comes with some additional features that enhance its functionality. It includes a USB charging port on the side, allowing you to conveniently charge your devices on the go. However, please note that you would need to provide your own power bank for this feature to work. The backpack also has a luggage strap on the back, which is useful for attaching it to a suitcase when traveling.

Value for Money:
Considering its overall quality and the added security features, the Anti-Thrift Backpack offers good value for money. While it may be slightly more expensive than regular backpacks, the peace of mind and practicality it provides make it worth the investment, especially for individuals who frequently travel or navigate crowded areas.

Conclusion:
The Anti-Thrift Backpack is an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable and secure backpack. Its anti-theft design, durable construction, ample storage capacity, and additional features make it a practical companion for daily use or travel. With its sleek design and functionality, this backpack is a worthy investment to protect your belongings and keep them organized."

4,Simply awesome.,"The build quality is beyond par for the pricing. It's durable and light weight at the same time. Holds a lot of items and still fits onto your back perfectly with flexible straps. The zippers are made nicely and the bag is totally water resistant except for the back mesh and the shoulder straps. The rain covers works wonderfully but water seeps in at times from the closure. Being a drawstring bag itself, the rain cover makes it easy to carry the bag during rains."

4,Great product,The quality is subperb. But just one point to highlight is the glue of plastic wrap that protects the logo. It doesn't wash off quickly. Rest happy with the bag!
3,Overall good product but issue with the power bank point in the bag,"The bag is really good in terms of material used to make which feels premium and durable as well as it is adequately spacious and all the necessary items fit within.

Only Problem i encountered is with the power bank pouch. The wire used inside the pouch feels of low quality as it seems to be not compatible with a fast charging power bank (example: MI power banks).
Also the external port through which the charging cable can be plugged into the phone seems to be of poor quality as the charging cable plugs out even with a slightest movement of the bag."

5,Review of Artic fox Bag,"The Arctic Fox Slope Anti Theft 23 L Backpack in Marble Black has proven to be a game-changer for my daily routine. Its sleek and stylish design caught my eye, but it's the practical features that truly impressed me. With a spacious 23 L capacity, this backpack accommodates all my essentials effortlessly. The anti-theft design adds a layer of security, providing peace of mind during my travels.

One standout feature is the built-in USB charging port, which has become invaluable for staying connected while on the move. The convenience of charging my devices on the fly has made this backpack an essential companion in my day-to-day life. The attention to detail in the craftsmanship is evident, and the durable materials used ensure longevity.

Whether I'm commuting, traveling, or heading to work, the Arctic Fox Slope Backpack not only complements my style with its Marble Black finish but also enhances my overall experience. It's a well-rounded, functional backpack that effortlessly combines aesthetics with practicality, making it a standout choice in the market. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and stylish companion for their daily adventures."
5,Secure and Spacious,"This bag, even though has only one zip compartment for Security reasons, has many pockets inside it to get the job done. Its laptop section is also fine for my 15"" laptop. I frequently use it for intercity travel as well as for my college and I have no complaints about it."
5,Bright color and super quality,"Best bag for carrying your laptop, cushion for your back is okish, material is best for this price point"
5,Comfortable Backpack,"This is one of the best backpack I ever had. Its way too comfortable when you wear it. You can have a laptop and put some books (according to your work)

It's water resistant but in the back pocket of the bag, there's a rain cover to protect the bag from heavy rain and so, you don't have to bring your bag under the umbrella when it rains.

I wanted the back because the last time, I had other bag and my wallet got stolen but this bag's chain are on the bag and it's nearly not possible for anyone to steal the valuables from the bag.

Worth of a product."
5,Good to go with,Nice bag with a stylish looks. Rain cover is not of use but that's fine. Usb portal is very useful.
5,Value for money,Great bag pack for daily life
5,A Practical and Secure Companion for Your Belongings,"I recently purchased the Anti-Thrift Backpack, and I must say it has proven to be a practical and secure companion for my belongings. Here's my comprehensive review of this unique backpack:

Design and Construction:
The Anti-Thrift Backpack features a sleek and modern design that is both visually appealing and functional. The exterior is made from a durable and water-resistant material that effectively protects the contents from the elements. The overall construction feels sturdy and well-built, ensuring longevity with regular use.

Anti-Theft Features:
One of the standout features of this backpack is its anti-theft design. It incorporates various security measures to keep your belongings safe. The main compartment of the backpack is concealed against your back, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access it without your knowledge. Additionally, the zippers are hidden and not easily visible, further deterring potential thieves. These anti-theft features provide peace of mind, especially in crowded or public settings.

Storage Capacity and Organization:
The backpack offers ample storage space, allowing you to carry your essentials and more. It features multiple compartments, including a padded laptop sleeve, a spacious main compartment, and smaller pockets for organizing smaller items like keys, pens, and a smartphone. The laptop sleeve provides excellent protection and can accommodate most standard-sized laptops.

Comfort and Ergonomics:
Comfort is an important factor when it comes to choosing a backpack, and the Anti-Thrift Backpack delivers in this aspect. The adjustable shoulder straps are padded and provide good support, reducing strain on your shoulders and back. The back panel is also padded and breathable, promoting airflow and preventing excessive sweating. However, for extended periods of heavy use, the padding on the shoulder straps could be slightly improved.

Additional Features:
The backpack comes with some additional features that enhance its functionality. It includes a USB charging port on the side, allowing you to conveniently charge your devices on the go. However, please note that you would need to provide your own power bank for this feature to work. The backpack also has a luggage strap on the back, which is useful for attaching it to a suitcase when traveling.

Value for Money:
Considering its overall quality and the added security features, the Anti-Thrift Backpack offers good value for money. While it may be slightly more expensive than regular backpacks, the peace of mind and practicality it provides make it worth the investment, especially for individuals who frequently travel or navigate crowded areas.

Conclusion:
The Anti-Thrift Backpack is an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable and secure backpack. Its anti-theft design, durable construction, ample storage capacity, and additional features make it a practical companion for daily use or travel. With its sleek design and functionality, this backpack is a worthy investment to protect your belongings and keep them organized."

-> good laptop padding for good laptop protection
->waterproof for my daily office rides
->trendy design for weekend getaway bag
-> ample space that can support my laptop, 1 diary, water bottle and 2 pair of dresses

This bag has surprised me by fulfilling all needs . The bag is designed remarkably well with a lot of hidden useful pockets.
3/4 th of the bag can be opened for arranging the contents of the bag.
Luckily it rained today, not a heavy one and found out that bag along with the rain cover provided is well and good for moderate rains as no water seepage has occurred.
Thanks Arctic Fox for giving free Mask and rain cover .
This bag is also a good attention grabber, as most of my colleagues have enquired today itself and where I bought this from.
In my opinion a good value for money product which is packed with features and quality which is lacking in this price range ."

5,üíï,"Nice product üòÄ
Good colity"
5,Arctic fox makes a products of supreme quality at a very budget price. This one is no exception.,"The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. This backpack is of that supreme quality. I am a very nitpicking man but did not find any dispute whatsoever. Every chain, compartment are designed very well. AF team graciously provided a n95 mask and a rain cover.
Receiving this in morning really made my day.
I would have to say arctic fox team is really making their product of highest quality that too based out in India. Really appreciate the team and also proud of the fact that this is an Make in India quality product.

Anyone who is looking for a budget backpack in this range look no further."
5,Good,Good to only carry laptop. Not much space
4,Bag is do not come with first aid,"Bag is overall is good my old bag still in fine position and I bought that 6yrs ago Skybags
Hope this bag last long too üíÄü§û"
4,Bag review,Liked this bag.Look wise and quality wise it's awesome.
4,Worthy,It's worth buying..
4,Space,"A great product, really happy with it.
1. My 15 inch laptop fits perfectly.
2. The pockets which company has offered are very nice, it depends upon the customers too as to which pockets they want to use it for.
3. You got rain cover with the bag itself, no need to purchase it spereatly.
4. I would recommend not to put anything electronic related items in back pocket of the bag as it might get wet when it's raining.

Although I really loved the product. ü§©"
4,Just a laptop backpack for antiteft,"It can fit in a normal slim laptop but with some difficulty, it can also fit in a gaming laptop. It has just one zip with multiple pouches inside with small and compact design."
4,Excellent,Iam getting on offer price its most worthy
4,Bag quality,Best
4,Comparatively very good,Good back
4,Space,Space is not so large..buy this bag only if you are a backbencher...can carry few books along with lunch ‚úåÔ∏è
4,Bag colour,The quality of the bag is very nice no complaint about it but the colour in the pic and the colour we receive are different. It's not grey on it's side it's somewhat greenish. Other than this the bag is worth buying
4,Quality product,"Well design and quality product, size is little bit smaller than i am expected"
4,Look good,Good quality and good anti theft
4,There is space issue,You cannot overfill it just 2 jeans with laptop or 5 books and laptop else the stuff is fabulous there is no quality problem
4,Top Quality,"Play Video
 Absolutely wonderful product... Loved it... Very ergonomic and light weight ... Fits nicely on your back"
4,Simply awesome.,"The build quality is beyond par for the pricing. It's durable and light weight at the same time. Holds a lot of items and still fits onto your back perfectly with flexible straps. The zippers are made nicely and the bag is totally water resistant except for the back mesh and the shoulder straps. The rain covers works wonderfully but water seeps in at times from the closure. Being a drawstring bag itself, the rain cover makes it easy to carry the bag during rains."
4,Nice product go for it..,By photos you will think that the patterns are gray color but it's actually green tone and in all review inside patern was different from my bag. So i have some confusion and i think they are decreasing the quality because price is decreasing.
4,The quality of the product is very good üëç.,"Its a very good product , one of the most popular bag that i ever wanted and would like to see more from the community. Little bit of expensive.satisfied with the product"
4,Stylish bag,nice looking but space is little less
4,Worth,Worth for money üíØ
4,Overall good bag,"Good quality, good looking bag, just 1 issue is that when I keep a book in it, after a day the book bends due to the bag."
4,Awesome really I like,Awesome product
4,Good Product,Must purchase
4,Good in this segment,There is no draw string and mask in this bag thats the only con . None the less it is a very good bag for college purpose
4,Great product,The quality is subperb. But just one point to highlight is the glue of plastic wrap that protects the logo. It doesn't wash off quickly. Rest happy with the bag!
4,Product Value,"The product is value for money. It product is very good looking and its design is awesome.
And, material is also good."
4,good produce,good product. Bit expensive
4,Review,Very good product.
4,Good at this price,
4,Nice,Nice product
4,Quality bag,"People around you will definitely ask bag mast he kidhar se liya
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê, thoda aur sasta hona chaiye tha between 1200-1300.."
4,You don't get the Drawstring Raincover!!,"The bag is great over all, saw a little tampering with the pack may be because of security reasons ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è over all bag is good but this bag do not come with the official drawstring raincover(personally that was the most sad thing... ) other than that yup its the best [still advised to buy from official website..ü´•]"
4,Size,Ideal for upto 15.6 inch laptop but not more than that.
4,product quality is very good,This bag quality is very good üíØüòä
4,Good looking and good quality,Worth for the price and really comfortable to carry and travel. And has good capacity to hold belongings
4,Good Quality Backpack,"After 3-4 months of usage.Nice bag ,good quality materials used ,many compartments, separate compartment for laptop and powerbank and comfortable on wearing.Negative is the storage is less ,i used to carry one laptop and 3 long sized notebooks and its full.The Water bottle pouch is too small only 500 ml water bottles can be carried."
4,Very little space in this bag,This is the best bag but Can carry very little stuff as there is very little space in this bag.
4,Prettty good bag,"The bag is good and the look are best
The quality is good"
4,About mask,I didn‚Äôt get the mask inside this. Although it was written that mask inside
4,One of the best laptop bags,"Update: I have been using this bag for more than a year. It has saved the laptop from two incidents, which would not be the case with other bags. The bottom padding and drizzle rain protection is top notch.

The Bag is one of the safe bags for laptop. You can only carry a few things along with the laptop as the overall capacity of the bag is less. But it serves the purpose of saving the laptop from any physical damages. The Arctic fox badge starts to get bad within 6 months. Over all the bag is a nice product."
4,"Poor packaging, awesome product üî•",Product is awesome for tech geeks and riders to carry laptop and other essentials
4,Good bag Bad zipper,The bag is really good and feels durable with a leather like material but the zipper doesn't look promising and feels really cheap
4,Superb product,"Amazing comfort,durability & value for money.I will recommend this product to everyone."
4,"Worthy of price, but lack space","It is a good product when it comes to using it as a laptop bag. But once you try to add just one shirt and jeans, it start feeling likes zips are going to break. Except for this thing, quality product. Not giving full 5 star only because of the very less space."
4,It's a good bag the only thing is it's bulky,"If you want a bag for traveling i won't suggest you this bag not even for the school only if you have a laptop go for it it will be secured and safe. The bag feels full and bulky even when it contains 1 book inside its not as water resistant as it claims water somehow seeps inside it. The bag earlier used to come with drawstring rain cover but now it's just a normal one and they don't include first aid kit as before now they give you a
N95 mask. overall it's a good product but not for everyone."
4,space,"less space, other than that it's good"
4,Got me compliments,"Quality of product is awesome and looks are just stunning, i get compliments wherever i go with this bag
I have a youtube channel (Umar Jamal) and wanted a bag to look stylish and to keep my equipment, This exceeded me expectations.
But it's a pain in the ass to open and close it, but for the look and feel i can ignore that.."
4,Good one but a scratch magnet...,"The bag looks fantastic and has a number of compartment which makes it a perfect travel bag.
But, the material is a scratch magnet, so I don't think it will look good after 6-7 months of use.
Other than that its all good, water resistance and laptop protection is surely upto the mark!"
4,It is good,"Yes i can say it is good
But the charging port in the bag doesn‚Äôt charger
The iPhone
Thats bad"
4,Good for you if you don't put much in your bag,Everything is best except the bag is too short.
4,quality is also good.. Lot of Copanamates I should put lot stuff's.,
4,Most wanted,Super product. Nice to see and carry all my things
4,Good quality and looks at the cost of total capacity,"Buy this one only if you want something durable but don't carry much luggage, cause with this one, you won't be able to carry much anyway."
4,Quality,Product impressed me
4,Nice but less space compared to price,"As per the price ... I feel like the space must be a bit more...
But the quality of material is nice ...

If i have to buy a bag again.. I would not buy it again, instead i would prefer.. A bag with more space.

Absolutely best for those who doesn't need much space..."
4,switching from skybag it feels a lot heavy,"ofc its not skybag, but in comparable price you are either buying a lightweight bag or a secure bag, cant get good of both the worlds. So chose wisely."
4,Good looking bag could have been having a fully opening compartment,The bag is really good in quality and looking but the main compartment cannot be fully opened as it is having an elastic connector rather than product is very good
4,Buy if your laptop smaller than 15.4,"If you have 15,15.2 inches laptop the you can consider this don't buy this if you have larger than 15.4 it's not fit in laptop compartment it's good backpack no doubt"
4,Epic,"I actually wanted a bag for all purpose, like travelling and college. Trust me Best choice
.
‚Ä¢Got it for 1400(and also 200cashback)
‚Ä¢Worth the money spent... don't think why it's expensive, brand hain ye premium
‚Ä¢Tough to use if never used a anti theft bagüòπ
‚Ä¢My Dell laptop for college work fits wellüòÅ

In short ""BUY IT IF YOU HAVE BUDGET"" Don't go for other options of artic fox if you want plain design"
4,Bag is Amazing Look,"Nice product ‚Äò Value for money
Bag look is Amazing ‚Äò Front side is leather Finishing is very wel‚Äô
kindly note The Bag is no water proof for your information
I Love this Bag ‚Äò I suggest you can buy the bag"
4,Quality of bag is premium but it is not more spacious,Delivery was good I am reviewing this bag after one month of use Bag quality is very good it is feel like premium bag it's so comfortable and easy to carry there are three compartments inside bag.chain quality is good. you can smoothly open or closed it. Concerns is only that it is not more spacious .you can only put laptop and some book in it It is not useful for travel purpose because u can not put many goods in it. Little bit pricy but overall good.i love it
4,"BAG QUALITY IS VERY GOOD, BUT NOT RECEIVED A FIRST KID WITH BAG,","BAG QUALITY IS VERY GOOD, BUT NOT RECEIVED FIRST AID KIT WITH BAG, I M VERY DISAPPONTING WITH THIS TYPE OF CHEAP ACTIVITY BY SELLERS"
4,Not much space for bottle.,"If you put bottle in the spot then it will press against your laptop. Also 15inch lap just barely fits in it so don't go it if you have bigger laptop. There is only one primary section, might be difficult to manage stuff all crumbled together."
4,A great bag,"The design is great, but the finishing is a bit off, there are some threads lying"
4,Just Awesome,I liked it
4,Quality is not bad..,"I liked the bag, but the price is too high according to bag."
4,Bag looks cool but advertising words seem more attractive.,"Bag looks beautiful but the concept of changing is of no such significance. Also that words used to advertise this bag is quite too much. Yes, it is different but the design is what I am talking about."
4,No mask inside and threads comming out in some places,Everything is good but you will find some threads comming out.and they have given mask which i dont recieved
4,Very good quality,"Like the quality of the Bag .....with many compatments....and it comes with...water cover and face mask......
I'll recommend this bag.."
4,not so spacious,a very good bag . but if it has an another compartment on top that would be much better
4,"Quality 5 Star, Stitches ü™° 4 Star","This is good bag and everything is fine.
But the stitch should be more strong as they were coming out."
4,Good work outshinny India guys,"I think guys from outshinny india are quite creative and understand their customers and evolve hence the outcome is great products with affordable prices .you guys are not only capturing the masses but also turning classes into masses. Nice bags for kids, youngsters and grownups"
4,A good product with a brand or strong durability.,Material is good and larger space But I think we need the storage little bit much moreüòÅ
4,Okayish product,This is a great bag for college if you have less things to carry .It is ideal as a basic tech bag.But if you want to insert your tiffin box and other things then it will overload .Less space and only one compartment .I recomend you to not to carry the rain cover in all seasons.Ypu can utilise that space for other purposes.
4,Arctic fox bag,The charging ports don't work
4,good quality,"a good quailty bag with good amount of sapce
just go for it. best in this budget"
4,Overall good bag,But one thing i don‚Äôt like in this vag is charging port is not working well
4,Good,Good
4,Just go for it, Best bag under this price range loved it
4,"Great quality for the price point, recommended","Look and feels and quality in top notch Missed compartments, need more pockets for keeping stuffs.
Still Satisfied with the purchase."
4,Awesome bag but not compatible 15.6 inch laptop,Quality is good but 15.6 inch laptop not fit easily
4,Loved it,I love it. Though personally I don't think the USB charging feature is useful.
4,"Good quality product, worth the price","Good quality product, worth the price"
4,Good,Good
4,Perfect bagpack but disappointed with packaging,"Seriously guys this is by far the best bag that i've purchased. The quality of the bag is superb and it is enough for day to day use. But packaging was really bad. The bag was not properly packed and it made a permanent wrinkle on the back side which to be honest is messing up the design. Anything else is perfect. The quality of rain cover is also okay but not that great.
Thank you Amazon but please do focus on packaging."
4,Good quality,"Good quality backpack that gets the job done. The storage is relatively less.. i mean it can fit upto 2 laptops, an iPad and their chargers and that's it"
4,Best,It's good for office going or college student
4,Usb port not working,Return twice still usb port doesnt work
4,Quality inside and outside is great,"Would have been gr8 if it was 3in1, as inn a side belt"
4,Nice bag in this price range,Buy it
4,WORTH FOR MONEY,HAD SOME SORT OF ISSUES
4,My Anti theft bag been Stolen Yesterday,My Anti theft bag been Stolen Yesterday
4,Good product,Good product... Value for Money
4,Charging port not working,"Everything good with the bag, just sad that the charging port isn‚Äôt working."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,Very Durable and well built
4,Durable,"Like the colour and design, it‚Äôs also durable for daily use"
4,Nice but not best,Quite good
4,Usb charging ain‚Äôt working,The charging USB port doesn‚Äôt work. Maybe it‚Äôs a defective ones but overall the bag is well built
4,Product worth money paid,Great bag with a lot of space but only thing that is little concerning is the durability of the leather finish material at the front of the bag
4,Overall good,"Bought it for my brother, it is a good bag. Spacious than it seems in the photos. It's costly though"
4,Great product,It is a great bag. Quality is top but in this bag there is only one compartment which disappointed me
3,Finishing is not up to mark..Not happy,On Some parts stitching is not properly done. And stains are also there. Need to improve the finishing
3,Bag size.,Smaller than expected.But quality is good.
3,Very good,"Play Video
 Looks good and worthy.."
3,Overall good product but issue with the power bank point in the bag,"The bag is really good in terms of material used to make which feels premium and durable as well as it is adequately spacious and all the necessary items fit within.

Only Problem i encountered is with the power bank pouch. The wire used inside the pouch feels of low quality as it seems to be not compatible with a fast charging power bank (example: MI power banks).
Also the external port through which the charging cable can be plugged into the phone seems to be of poor quality as the charging cable plugs out even with a slightest movement of the bag."
3,Not received proper items as included with the product.,Didn't receive any mask and rain cover with this backpack.
3,Not same as shown in photos,"The outer quality of the bag is good but inside quality is not good and the zip quality is very cheap üòï in this prize range they should have gave us metal zips, and the inside colour of the bag is different from the photos shown in this page I thought I will get silver colour inside but it's black really dispointed:("
3,Overall Good bag but,"If you have a Gaming laptop (i have Dell G15 5515) its very difficult to fit in, if you have any notebook 15.6"" it'll fit easily, but the space for laptop thickness wise is a bit less. Overall bag is of good quality and built."
3,Look wise amazing 5/ 5. Quality wise 3/5. Storage wise 2/5,"Looks 5/5
Storage 2/5
Quality 3/5"
3,"Great with build quality, but everything in not in this package.","Not too spacious to add tiffin along with laptop üò§, rest of things are good to go."
3,Quality and packaging,Quality is not so bad but product packaging quality is so bad and it affects the product üòî
3,Average,Waise to bag theek hai must buy but iske straps chote hai aur isme 1 compartment hone ke karan app baad me iritate ho sakte hain isme 1 ltr water bottle fit hone me problem hoti hai
3,"Good bag, a little less space.","The bag design is great, it's comfortable to wear as well. It's anti-theft is alright. But when I purchased the bag it came with loose strings out in the stitches because of which the zip wouldn't move. It is really constricted in its space, you cannot place a lot of stuff despite what you may think. It is great for light travel though, the rain cover has a slot in the bag you can keep at all times and is great.
Overall it's a decent purchase as long as you know it isn't for packing too many things. It's comfortable and looks good, is good quality material as well so seems like it'll last real long."
3,Avarage product,Inside space is very small. Design and quality is good.
3,Not come in same colour,But build quality is good and superb for college
3,Stitching is not good as brand like safari.,"pros
Bag material quality is really good.
It looks really premium.
Safe for my hp pavilion laptop.
Zippers quality is fine.

Cons
Low quality metal zippers in small pockets.
Threads coming out from stitched area.(hope it will last)
Med kit not provided. (Only a COVID mask
.
.
Conclusion-you should go for this bag (only for lite use) like laptop and gadgets.
I am not sure about its stitching ,hope it will last long .
."
3,Product is really good,"Product is looking awsm
You don't regret after buying"
3,Stitching is not good, Stitching is open someplace and threads is not cut well . Material is good quality but finishing is also important
3,little satisfied,bag was good although raincover was changed
3,Missing Mask.,"this is a cool backpack. but they didn't include the mask they said they'll include. it was missing from the package. apart from that, it is a pretty nice backpack. but yeah, missing mask and the package wasn't even tampered with. searched every part of the backpack. couldn't find."
3,Best Quality but space is very less,Best quality but space is very less
3,worth the price but little congested,"Bag is pretty good , especially the padding , waterproofing and good build quality. Don't think i'll even need the rain cover .But zip gets stuck sometimes and i wish it was little more spacious and had another seperate compartment because after my laptop and books there's barely any space left for other things. water bottle holder is too small , doesn't expand much. having foam padding on the back side might have added some comfort.
Overall it's good for college use, can carry about 10 notebooks , a laptop and some accessories, not meant for travelling."
3,IT'S TOO SMALL,OVERALL QUALITY AND OTHER ASPECTS ARE GREAT BUT IT'S TOO SMALL IN SIZE. AND WHEN I TRIED TO RETURN THE PRODUCT THERE WAS NO OPTION AVAILABLE FOR RETURN.
3,Entirely Different.... Experience !,"I liked this bas a lot, and a friend of mine recommended me this bag. But it doesn't feel that worth.
The zipper quality is very bad, and the PowerBank port is not functional.... It's not working.
The space too is very less than expected, hardly 4 books.
The bag is very stiff, Actually discomfortable while it's on the back.

Considering good, better and best...
It is good !"
3,USB port not working.,"I ordered the product for college use and after 2 days I found that USB port was not working. Also I can't replace the product because I was shifting to my college in other state. And when I came to college, I found that my roommate also have same backpack with not working USB port."
3,A bit less spacious then expected,"A bit less spacious, a gaming laptop and 3pieces of garments will tke up all of the space tho chargers cables and other documents stuff can be kept. But it will be tightly arranged"
3,missing!!!!,mask is missing and quality of rain cover in not good.....
3,Brand logo shifted, Actually quality is good for usable but there brand logo shifted so please improve immediately & only rain cover is present there not given any first aid kit.
3,Product review,Slightly good
3,Nice,Nice looks but got different colour and no mask
3,Good Quality bag but small capacity,The bag quality is good. But the capacity is very low due to the design. Not too convenient to keep and take items often.
3,Good Bag,It's a good product but quality can be improved. Not sure if this is waterproof or not but good look
3,Too much wide,Too much wide. The picture is not enough to get a clear idea. Water resistant only when water falls on top of it not when it falls in a water pool or road pothole. Water will enter it in that case. Security features are good as mentioned. But that can be cut easily if the thief has good cutting equipment. Value for money if you are getting it under your 1400. Prices fluctuate on Amazon. Avoid buying at 1999. Not worth 1999.
3,Not enough space for carrying daily essentials to work.,I bought this bag after seeing that they give full rain cover which others dont give. The bag doesnt have that much storage volume. You can't even carry a small cylindrical lunch box along with laptop. Its better to go with more volume bags if you carry other things with laptop.
3,Warranty just for showcasing. They are least bothered about customer satisfaction and retention!,"Got this bag a month ago...looks good...the chargable concept is funny it just transfers the powerbank's charge to your phone, but thats ok what bothered me the most is its been more than 2 weeks since i have applied for a warranty but have not received any reply from them, as asked i submitted my details and the bill but invain. I tried connecting to them but of no help, I wonder if the warranty is just for showcasing."
3,Artic fox,Bag is good but not water proof
3,Space is very limited because of the thick and sponzy material used to make bag,I put my laptop and doc file which cover around 60% of space if i have to put pair of cloths it would be very difficult as it dosent have sperate compartments.
3,Very low space,Material quality is good. But no sufficient space.
3,Medi kit wasn't provided,Quality is enpressive but medi kit wasn't provided with backpack
3,Stylish but uncomfortable,The bag looks nice and stylish but fails somehow as a bag. Something is off with the design that your shoulders hurt after a bit and the space inside isn't great either to carry a lot of stuff. There is a pouch for a bottle but too small for almost any bottle lol.
3,Drawstring bag not provided,I got normal rain cover. Drawstring bag not provided. That is the only drawback from me. Bag quality is superb.
3,ok type of product,Not as sturdy as I think. But it is ok we are using it
3,Not bad for the money,"The quality is good, water resistance is ok, but they include a rain cover so that covers the issue, not as big as shown in the pictures, definitely not 23 lit, maybe 19lit and that's stretching it."
3,No first aid kit,No first aid kit provided as promised
3,Stitching,Not the best stitching material.
3,Okayish,Didn't like the model or structure of the bag
3,Quality not satisfied,Quality not staisfied

2,Not As Soon In YT Videos,"Bag is Good But Not What We See In Youtube Videos,

Video Shows They Give MediKit, But in real their is mask, Which is not even seems high quality,

Rain Cover, In Yt you see a rope with it, so you can wear bag on raincover but however now bags don‚Äôt have that, so its hard to carry in that,

Handles seems not much strong,

Its look great, great branding, but they shouldn‚Äôt change what shows in Youtube,

Seems like cost cutting, i was expecting much better but however I won‚Äôt returning, as its seems fine at this cost, but not fully happy"
2,Poor stitching quality,"Play Video
 Its not even been 3months, but the stitching near the shoulder strap came out. Warranty service is waste. They'll ask you to ship the product to thier office in Bengaluru for them to repair it."

2,USB not working,USB port not working
2,Faulty charging port,"The port where you are supposed to plug the USB cable is stitched up as well, thus I am unable to plug my USB cable, making it useless. Apart from that minor problem was the zipper chain at the side is also not working properly. Rest everything seems fine for now. Only reason that I'm not giving this 1 star is that the product material seems good."
2,Bag should have some stretchable material for main compartment.,If Bag should have some stretchable material at both sides of main compartment then it could be completely handy bag in all situations.

2,Don't Buy,Product is Good But Packing Like Road Chap..

4,Works well and I wish they should provide hook instead of clip upside,Good for travel and works quite well. I wish they shoud provide a hook instead of clip upside to hold it. It is quite difficult for single person to lift bag and see the reading. It does not have also a feature to lock the display when weight it done which would have been helpful. Someone needs to see the reading while you are holding bag and this works or you can use this to hang on something.
4,Value for Money,"Must have & an essential item of travel kit. Compact in size, handy and value for money product. Plastic quality is average but display is good and fonts are visible."
4,Nice portable weigh balance.,"Its value for money. It is almost accurate when weighed. Easy to carry.
Display not bad. Average quality plastic material used. Seems like a nice add-on to travel needs"
4,Good,Battery exostes fast..
4,Good,For 50 kg weight not suitable. Max for 20 to 25 kg .Otherwise you need gorilla's grip to hold it...
4,Good product -But carrying handle hurts,"Product is good as per price. quality is fine. Not perfect in accuracy, it works fine not that accurate in grams. Carrying handle is small so it hurts when you use it for heavy weights. Otherwise product is good in this price."
4,Essential,It‚Äôs good.
4,The scale is very accurate,Value for money guaranteed.
4,Good,Durability
4,genuine review‚ù§Ô∏è,Good one. Weight measurings are correct.. Up to 50 kg will hang.plastic body but strong. Nice one value for money ‚ù§Ô∏è
4,Good product,But with time the battery terminals got eroded
4,Good,Good
4,Good product,"It‚Äôs been a week, product came with manual and battery. Working good for now, China made, I will keep you updated if any challenges in future."
4,"Useful but it has some ""handling"" issues","The weight machine is very compact and can fit in your pocket. However, this comes with problems. The first one being that the handle is not proper. You will need to hold the metal handle and only your fingers will fit in and when you lift the weight, it will be very hard. The whole weight it being handled by your fingers only as you can't hold it properly and the handle will be leave marks on your fingers, stop the blood flow on your fingers temporarily which will hurt you very badly. In order to use it, you will need to set it up on a flat heavy rod and then hang your items into the given hook. But this is not always possible as you can't always have this kind of setup everywhere you go.

Hence, this product would be very useful if you plan to use it at your home but also have a proper setup but if you plan on using it on the go or don't have a setup then get ready to get some soar fingers."

3,Works well but measuring is a bit problematic,"Works well, value for money and a must have for Travels.
One problem (major one) as other reviewers also mentioned , it has really small handle to hold it for lifting up. So you need 2 people , 1 to pickup and other to check the weight.
And if luggage is really heavy 20kg+ , it's hard to pick up with that small handle."
3,Some time its works and don't,Some time its works and some time do not work you have to unload it and press button again to make it work

 The weighing scale came with a decent, sturdy package, and the quality of the material is also good. I assume the product is working as expected and displaying accurate readings. The backlit LCD display makes it more visible and attractive."
5,Review of my last product purchased with amazon,"I recently purchased a new weighing machine, and I've been quite satisfied with its performance. This weighing machine offers several notable features that make it stand out.

First and foremost, its accuracy is impressive. It consistently provides precise weight measurements, which is crucial for anyone tracking their fitness progress or monitoring their health. The large and clear digital display ensures that readings are easy to read.

The machine itself is sturdy and well-built. It feels robust and durable, capable of withstanding regular use. The platform is spacious, accommodating users of various sizes comfortably. Additionally, it has an automatic on/off feature, which helps conserve battery life and is convenient for quick measurements.

One of the features I appreciate the most is the ability to switch between different units of measurement, such as pounds or kilograms, which makes it versatile for various users.

Overall, this weighing machine has been a reliable addition to my home. It provides accurate readings, is well-constructed, and offers user-friendly features. If you're in the market for a dependable and accurate weighing machine, I would certainly recommend considering this one."

4,Accurate but locks the weight for each weighingg,"Fairly accurate product which I purchased to weigh airline check-in baggage. This serves the purpose.
However it locks the weight of the bag and needs to be reset for each weighing!"
4,Working as average.,"Works as not fully expected but good at this price range. I weighed one kg of sugar of 1000gm. When you hang it on this scale, you got 990 gm or 995 gm. So I am not explaining any more."

People are complaining about the grip. To be fair , i can understand why they are feeling that. But, for me personally,, its not an issue. I checked the weight of a Gas cylinder delivery which is of around 30 kg. It was pretty easy for me. I think, I can go upto 40 kg with not much problem.
Build Quality seems good.
Buttons are Clicky with good tactile feedback.
The weight of the device itself is 156 Grams which is also good, if you want portability.
Just put a good quality pair of cell, the cells that come with it are of low quality and charge may get low anytime while traveling."

4,Good buy,"Good product. Weight is exact and as mentioned it is just the difference of 5 or 10 Gms. Only drawback is to lift heavy luggages. It hurts the hand so use some cloth to lift., also you need one more person to view the weight because you cannot lift and view at the same time. But for this price it is a definite buy üëç"

4,Works well and I wish they should provide hook instead of clip upside,Good for travel and works quite well. I wish they shoud provide a hook instead of clip upside to hold it. It is quite difficult for single person to lift bag and see the reading. It does not have also a feature to lock the display when weight it done which would have been helpful. Someone needs to see the reading while you are holding bag and this works or you can use this to hang on something.

4,Good product,"It‚Äôs been a week, product came with manual and battery. Working good for now, China made, I will keep you updated if any challenges in future."
4,"Useful but it has some ""handling"" issues","The weight machine is very compact and can fit in your pocket. However, this comes with problems. The first one being that the handle is not proper. You will need to hold the metal handle and only your fingers will fit in and when you lift the weight, it will be very hard. The whole weight it being handled by your fingers only as you can't hold it properly and the handle will be leave marks on your fingers, stop the blood flow on your fingers temporarily which will hurt you very badly. In order to use it, you will need to set it up on a flat heavy rod and then hang your items into the given hook. But this is not always possible as you can't always have this kind of setup everywhere you go.

Hence, this product would be very useful if you plan to use it at your home but also have a proper setup but if you plan on using it on the go or don't have a setup then get ready to get some soar fingers."

4,Good for weighing at home. slight accuracy difference. Useful for travelers.,"I was checking for the weighing machine which is useful for travel luggage weightage at airport.
I searched for lot of brands and even tried to purchase branded one. But at last i decided to go with ""Glun"" brand based on the reviews.
The delivery was quick and delivered in 2 hours. I purchased for 250 Rs.
I weighted my household items(Oil packet, honey bottle, etc.). All counts are matching with the product weight (10 to 50 gms difference). For this you have to make 5% margin on 1kg. so accuracy will be 95%. Even branded machines also will do the same margins.
Pros:
-------
1. Easy to use
2. light weight and easy to carry in your bag.
3. Useful for frequent travelers.
4. No need to panic at airport on the luggage limit hiccups.
5. Easy to measure at home with different Unit options.
6. Batteries provided.
7. GLUN brand printed on device.
8. Digital display with background green color.

Cons:
--------
1. Slight accuracy difference ( 20 to 50 gms difference on 1 kg). 95% accurate.
2. Display is visible on straight angle. you have to keep straight with your eye. not a 360 viewable.
3. Back battery closing panel is not smooth to open.

My final point : Gohead with Glun brand weighing machine with out any doubt."
4,Handy bag weight,Good quality for bags weights easy to use battery operated
4,A Must Have Digital Weighing Hook,"This is a handy and helpful weighing hook. It's weighing capacity is 50KGs. I've taken it for measuring weight of Airport Check-in Luggage bag because most of the time we fill our luggage more than the allowed weight. As I've this digital weighing machine now, I can make optimum use of the allowed weight while traveling by flight. Considering the price this is a best product at 265 rupees only. The machine is strong and it can really hold weight till 50 kgs. Thanks !!"
4,Good one if you are traveling,I bought this when I had to travel by air to weigh my bags. The machine is good but its slot for battery has some loose spring which makes it difficult to put and take out the battery. The measurement was accurate.

It displayed my luggage as 22.75 kg and the airline check in counter weigh machine also display few gram less than that. Only bad side of this product is , it‚Äôs display screen is on side, I would prefer the display on top so that it is easy to see the weight while weighing. Also the initial display before we can weigh any item stays little longer, so we have wait few seconds before weighing the luggage again."

One problem (major one) as other reviewers also mentioned , it has really small handle to hold it for lifting up. So you need 2 people , 1 to pickup and other to check the weight.
And if luggage is really heavy 20kg+ , it's hard to pick up with that small handle."

3,Good Product but not the best to buy,Overall product is good but received 2 dead batteries. Why have seller added 2 batteries in the description if you're just sending dead and we need to buy new batteries for additional cost. Packinging could be improved more.
3,Ok kind of but low weights are not detected properly,I tried using it with 5 kg dumbell and it worked nice but when i used 1 kg chana dal to weigh it was not detecting the weight. so looks good for heavy wight

3,Not able to access weight.,It shows some weight and when we keep it down it shows correct weight. We cannot keep holding nearly 15 kgs and hold for long time to see weight.
3,Works but not easy on hand and it seems they send used product,"I ordered a luggage weighing scale because my old weighing scale stopped working. I received it today and tried to weigh my traveling luggage. It was hard on hand as the grip doesn't have any cushion and is a hard metal.

This is good for light luggage but if you have anything more than 10 kg, it will be hard to weigh using this scale."
3,Not usefull thay don't want to experiment how to use,"Display is off when you use that time agen you switch it on and hang wait on it.
Battery cam with is useless. Battery all dead came with this product. If don't want to give good condition battery so don't give with them
Product is useful easy to carry. First try to home how to use."
3,Electric portable scale,"Worth for the price , product is good , in the packing battery is demage, I have checked with alternate batter till 20 kg it's worked"
3,Build quality poor,"Build quality is poor, the buttons are wobbly, paint is chipping, backlight is on only for a few seconds and turns off just when you are about to read it. It will need 2 people to measure something, one holds the weight and the other reads it before the backlight goes off."
3,Serves it's purpose,"Day 1 Review:
Product was delivered in a safe package with bubble wrap. After opening the box, came the shock. Batteries provided in the package is corroded and didn't work at all (had to use the batteries from TV remote).

Quality of the weighing machine is not up to the mark. Very light plastic is used for build. Hooks are big and good. But top handle doesn't get locked while closing it (happens on other models). Buttons are of okay quality.

Accuracy: Checked with a 1kg weighing metal and it showed 990gm.

Overall feedback: It serves it's purpose, but unhappy with the batteries provided. (Why shouldn't we?? Price includes the batteries as well.. Doesn't it???)"
3,Good,They put the bad battery it doesn't work I spent my extra money for battery
3,Quality is very average but it's functional....,Batteries provided are expired / very old. We need to throw them & use new batteries to start this weighing clamp..
3,Not working properly,After completion of weight not locking end weight result
3,Average,Average product.. Not very accurate but ok to get an idea of the weight
3,This product is not worthy, I dislike this product due to this product stop working after a short while due to low quality battery leakage of battery destroy this product

I know this because I have sent a courier which was 8kg but this machine show me 8.460. Same goes with while traveling through. Bag was 13 kg+ but it shown me 500+ extra weight. But it helped at this price. It's almost accurate.
3,Good for domestic use,Good but not very accurate also lots of scratches in it.
3,Average,"Pros:
+ Compact and can be carried easily anywhere
+ Average quality product

Cons:
- The meter seems to be off by 60gm (even though advertised to be off of 5gm)
- Very very bad packing.
- Missing batteries"
3,Quality not good,"1st I have received a faulty device which display not working, blackspot on LCD screen. After receiving the 2nd one it's working, but it has rust in the battery connector and looks like a used product. I don't know how long it will work ?

I don't know how its is ""Amazon's Choice"""
3,Thank you Amazon üòä,"Needed for home, traveling and logistics purpose. Good to have it for verification purposes and for the record purposes."
3,Unhappy,Iske sath battery nahi mili muje
3,Good product. Free Batteries useless,"First thing first. It‚Äôs pretty accurate but as soon as the weight is removed the reading changes. I wish it would stay for a few seconds so that it‚Äôs easier to read it after lifting heavy luggage. Right now luggage is to be lifted till eye level to read it. I guess stronger people won‚Äôt have this issue.

Also, batteries provided are crap and not working with the scale.
Note to seller - stop scamming people and mentioning that free battery is provided."
3,Average item,Average item
3,Good,Product quality is good as per the price sometimes error comes measuring the weight out of hundred 90 Times it worked properly
3,Function has some stabilization issues,Scale not ready to function in some times.
3,Worst packaging,Worst packaging I ever seen battery üîã was discharged if you want to buy you have to buy battery cell from outside
3,Doesn't look accurate,Don't think the reading is accurate also it keeps changing. I think sometimes it is off by 500 gms. If you just want to have an approximate reading you can go for this.
3,The cells received with the item is not working,The dry battery cells supplied weren‚Äôt working. I had to purchase new one to start the item.
3,Looks fine,Has scratches a bit (must be due to poor storage facility) but functioning seems good so far.
3,Value for money,"Pros -
Accurate reading
Easy to carry

Cons -
This model does not beep once the reading is done. Though in lock mode the reading is captured after the weight is released but with heavy luggage/ weight sometimes not very easy to know when the reading is captured."

3,Good product,Like
3,Nice,Ok
3,No Unit Convertion.,"After two times (one replacement and one return), Third time only i got this product with unit convertion function. But i received Glun Moreblue instead of Glun Bolt.

3,poor quality,"not the good one , stopped working in a month"
3,Plastic quality is not good,Plastic quality is not good.
3,Useful for less than 20 kg weight,I like this product. This product accuracy depends on weight. Less than 20 kg it shows good accuracy but more than 30 kg it's weight not stable.
3,Okay,Always need to switch off/On to get 0 value for checking the weight
3,Not so good. For home use further improvement is required in respect of accuracy in reading.,Same comment as stated above.
3,Not Very Accurate,Gives an error of 2 Kg Range
3,Quality should be good at the end,"When delivered, product was already opened & the arteries provided with it were in bad condition, so had to purchase new one."
3,Durable but accuracy rate will be less if you r not properly hold it,"Problem is when you tilt slightly. It show wrong measurement. You can't see display if display is not straight to u. If weight if more then it is difficult to measure correctly. Angle will tlit. But it's durable so u can use daily purpose.
But you have to hang it properly."

2,Quality,Quality is not good
2,Chinese,Not working - made in China
2,Great tool until the hook fell off,"It is a handy and sturdy looking hand scale.
With the hook you can lift the luggage easily.
The handle is a bit on the smaller side.
If you have over 15kg luggage it is difficult to lift with one hand.

The only drawback is that I my case the hook got disengaged after lifting 32kg luggage piece. Now it is difficult to put it back together."
2,Very bad design to handle,Not easy to handle weight like 23 kgs
2,Not accurate,Shows different reading each time

2,Fast discharge of cell within ~10 days on switched off position,"Item is not good. On receipt of the item it works satisfactory but its quality performance is very poor. The detect it has, can't be checked within stipulated period of return. It is to my surprise that battery cells get discharged completely within ~10 days on switched off position. It has been also checked by replacing 3 sets of battery cells. All sets got discharged completely.
Considering my purchase history and my rating I request to Amazon to compensate to either open return tab or send me gift voucher to order new one of other make."

 Can we get help now"
2,Showing totally incorrect weighment. Useless product.,"When I weighted one item on this machine, it was showing 33.3 kgs whereas the correct weight was 13.2. The claim of seller that it can be used for weighment upto 50kgs stands rediculous. Useless product. Don't buy it.of course it is very convenient to Cary wit us, but what for?"
2,Not at all accurate,It's not accurate And also there is a lag. You have weight n weight then It will measure weight. You have to keep pressing the buttons

Th product maybe good but that is secondary now."

2,Grm problem,Grm problem
2,On / off issues,we have to try and push buttons again and again to on/off it
2,"Digits will be locked, in irder to adjust weight you have take the weight from the glun and and","When it comes to accuracy part, for the same weight it showed different digits. Also the digits are locked(suppose when you are trying to weight chilli, rava where you want measure 1kg, initially what weight is added will be locked and it is not possible to adjust to weight to 1kg by adding more chillies or taking out)...the thing is digit will be locked at the first use"
2,Accuracy could be much better,Very handy light weight weighing tool. But accuracy could be much better. You cant get the accurate weight. Weight the same thing twice - it will give different result. For light weight things of 200-500 gms this error makes it untrustworthy.
2,Not accurate,"if you measure 3 times, it will show 3 different measurements.A difference of 10-30 grams each time."
2,Rusted product received,"Product received is rusted. I ordered for 2 pieces, one was good other was rusted"

2,Got old stuff with spoiled batteries,"The product I got had dust on it and looked old. Batteries were rotten, thought of returning but it worked and gave the weight of the items we measured so dropped the thought. Just a question, how can you deliver a old product? Lack of responsibility I say."
2,Nice weighing scale wh,Nice weighing scale when I ordered first time the seller gave 2 dead battery so I returned and ordered it again but again he sent dead AAA battery

2,Rusted batteries,"I would have been good if you didnt send batteries along, but its a shame to give rusted died-out batteries to your customers. Its an insult to me. Product worked fine, so I give you 2 stars."
2,Not as expected,"Its a Chinese product; the measurement varies and its not easy to use, have to reset (on/off) to get the reading."
2,Not properly working,Accuracy is not up to the mark. You have to push the button so many times to check the weight. Not working properly. As I was on tour immediately after purchase I couldn't return it in prescribed time limit.
2,Weak ring should be replaced with stronger one,The ring that connects the hook with the unit is too weak to handle weight beyond 5kg. It is advisable to replace the ring with a stronger one to handle luggage up to the specified capacity Thanks

May it be cash, visiting cards, passport size photos, chillar, you can store up 10 things in here.

Talking about the Colour, I was a bit disappointed when it arrived. As the colour shown on app is different from what I've received. But it's fine, the colour doesn't matter if quality is good.

The weight of the wallet is a but higher than normal. First few days, you really get annoued carrying this. But after a time, you'll be comfortable carrying it in your pocket.

Summarising it, at this price you're getting a really good deal. It's worth purchasing."

5,Big and spacious,"I bought this wallet for ‚Çπ 470/- and following are my observations.

PROS:
üëç The best thing i liked about this is the look. The texture and the colour gives it that refreshing feel. Looks classy. Light brown looks different from conventional black or dark brown wallets.
üëç Wallet is quite well organised.2 notes compartment, one spacious coin part, 9 card holders which fit debit/credit cards quite well, Two transparent part for keeping a picture and a chained compartment below the card holder & coin pouch to keep anything important safely.
üëç The quality is quite good.
üëç Notes compartment is quite big and can hold Old style ‚Çπ100 note too quite easily which is bigger than the new design of notes.

CONS:
üëé It's a very big wallet and leaves an undesirable large footprint when kept in jeans pocket.

4,good product,"atcha hain lekin material thora aur atcha ho sakta tha, agar joldi joldi main koi isme paise rakhe aur thora jor se khise, to iye fat sakta hain, baki iska RFID protection aur jyada space hone ke karon sijo ko rakhne main dikkat nahi hota hain."
4,"Material color is premium look ,but",Its lightly scratched by hand its look bad

4,Good product,Good product
4,Great quality product,Value for money and touchy feel is very comfort
4,Good product but not perfect!,Product quality is good apart from the cheap looking middle zip. The press-button which holds the card holder will damage the credit card which literally makes few slots unusable.
4,Nice product,Nice quality
4,Good wallet for daily use,I am writing this review after 3 month use of this product. I found this product is very good and comfortable in my pocket.
4,Quality was nice,Quality was nice
4,Nice.,Good product. I liked it.
4,If your on a budget and especially if your a Student..its good Enough!!,"The product more or less does match the pics displayed on the site, at first I was concerned after reading the reviews and I thought it is very bad and I wouldn't like it and it won't be durable and would be really cheap material but honestly, after receiving it..it is not amazing but it's decent, I hope it is gonna be durable and it does feel nice in the hand...my only issue is it's very big its a huge wallet for me I personally never carry in the pocket it always in my bag so its fine but for someone who carries it in their pocket it might be a little bit of concern. Overall it's a good product."
4,Ok,Quality is ok but little big from my old wallet
4,Good for the gifting purpose.,Colour is very nice. Quality is average. Lots of compartments to store enough items in a wallet.
4,Material is good,Good material. Only thing is that the colour is not as bright as it looks in photo. But for last two years I am using this. Satisfy with the quality.
4,Looks good .,"While I liked the product, am not sure about its durability since it has been gifted away . Also, it might get bulky when cards and cash are kept .

Overall , nice looking wallet ."
4,Good,All good
4,Excellent quality. But catches dirt very quickly,"Great quality. Leather is sturdy. Feels very premium. Initially it may feel very hard but within 3 to 4 times of use it becomes soft and fits perfectly in the pocket.
Note: It is a very big wallet. Buy only if you have a habit of carrying big wallets.
The only con is it catches dirt quickly and the look is faded after a month"
4,Overall Good to have,I'm satisfied
4,Nice Quality,"Overall nice Quality.
Material is pretty nice, feels premium & looks durable."
4,Fashionable product!,"Design is good

4,Awesome,Quality is too good but it should be little thin
4,Silai remove after 3 month useg only & colour change,"Play Video

And not respon warranty"
4,Meet the expectations, A nice and handy product meet the expectations
4,Size is big,Product is having good quality. But size is little big and fat due to more pockets. Buy if you are ok with big size
4,Its with me for a year,"Great wallet, feels substantial , material quality is good... leather will eventually darken with use but still will look green
Chain is good
pockets are sturdy
Rfid cage works. Cant use metro card when inside wallet.

Overall I am a fully satisfied customer and would recommend this on 400 -600 price range."
4,Very good product original leather wallet,Original leather wallet very good product so smooth finished & this is the best
4,AN HONEST REVIEW OF THE WALLET,It's a great wallet. Expect it to arrive in a different colour as its in a green shade in reality. It looks to be pretty durable as the stitching is pretty good and the leather fells premium at the price. The packaging was brilliant for the wallet and the price. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is in the last pic you can see there are surface leather scratches but very minor. if you can extend your budget by a 100 bucks you should go for the blue one with the remove able card holder
4,Good product,good wallet I can say good leather and good look so go for it
4,Good one.,I know before buying that colour is going to be different and yes it is. But apart from that leather quality is hard and there are so many compartments in it which makes it bigger in size than other wallets and also it will not be much bulkier even without single penny in it. Even if you keep money in it that size don't seems to get bulkier. I don't know how that happens. I gave 5 stars because of the details they added in wallet and number of different compartments for different use. I got it on offer for 450. You can try it if you're ok with carrying bulky wallet. It even comes with transparent compartment where you can either keep id or photo of your family or loved ones that much of wallets now a days don't give. It's really worth to buy it because of it's style and space and details they gave for a wallet.
4,"Good Quality, cheap price","Pros:
1. Delivered on time
2. Material is good. Feel is great.
3. It has a place for coins and enough card slots
4. It's budget friendly

Cons:
None"
4,Nyc product,Some cards size doesn't fitting
4,Good large size wallet,"Good quality product,value for money got at a discount offer price .Nice packaging suitable for gift Slightly larger in size then normal wallet may cause some initial discomfort while placed in pant rear pocket due to size .Definitely worth the buy."
4,Good Stuff... can be used....,Good Stuff... can be used....
4,Good and value for money product,Leather quality is very good and soft enough. Overall the product is very good
4,Could have been designed better,"The purse looks over bulky with cards. The card doesn't fit to card holder easily . It takes about a three seconds to insert into card holder. The colour I ordered was blue , but the arrived package looks greenish. It's rough and has the look. The whole of the card segment seems to be on right side of purse and makes it bulgy and maybe the card segments could have distributed on both sides to reduce bulkiness. The purse looks good without anything inside !!"
4,Worth for the price,Colour is entirely different from what i have ordered. And quality wise it's good value for money. The leather seems genuine quality. It's sturdy and they gave more useful provisions for various things. Except the colour variations the product is worth for the price.
4,Perfect,Bought this as a gift for my dad... its a perfect gift for someone who uses alot of cards as there are lots of card slots available... and its compact body makes it handy to carry although the colour isn‚Äôt really the same as it was in the picture but it would be better if it was and for the price it‚Äôs amazing value ... I bought it for 545 rs. However with latest offers you could go down in price and get a better value for money. The leather is very stif but as you use leather it only gets softer. The stiffness only makes it uncomfortable at start but you get what you pay for ! I am in love with the product and its a perfect gift for my dad! Btw don‚Äôt worry the colour that you receive isnt that bad ... I am yet to give it to him !

3,Colour not as shown in the image,"Above photo is what i got. Below is the photo shown in Amazon.
If you are ordering this just for good looks. Don't order.
If you just want good quality, then go ahead."
3,Size,Good in quality but too big in size uncomfortable to keep in pockets of pant n shirt
3,Good,Superb but not original leather
3,Your debit cards wont fit in d dedicated slots. Your id proofs will fit in the dedicated slots.,Wats d use of giving thise slots for debit cards wen standard sized debit cards do not fit? Id cards/proofs fit in its dedicated slots. D more stuffs u put d wallet expands. N then it wll b uncomfortable to put in your jean' pockets.

3,Hard material,Rfid working
3,Quality,Quality not so good
3,Not Bad,"Everything is good but I expected the product to be slim and thinner.

Material/Leather is good.

Slight colour difference in front and back part"
3,It is good,"It is good with the quality but the colour ,
I think it is too dull"
3,Okayish,Colour was very dark almost black even though I ordered the blue one
3,Small card size,Card sizes are very small not fit a single credit cards etc. If u want to purchase only for keeping money it is good but not suitable for cards etc. Wastage of money.
3,DO NOT LET THE COLOUR DECEIVE YOU!!!,"First of all, the delivery time is way too long, it took 5-6 days to be delivered.

The product arrived with a different colour hue - got it replaced - the same arrived once again - found it too much of a hassle to replace it again, so kept it.

Okkkaaayyy, aside from the colour, the leather quality is good, the stitching is good, the compartments are well placed and it's durable. It has a certain charm to it. I like it.

It's a good purchase, except for the fact that you won't receive the colour displayed.

Whether it is worth it, you decide, as you can always return it.

Hope this was helpful."
3,Not Good.,"The Product Doesn't Look like as per the images, And Get Permanent marks even with the slightest scratch ( This was mentioned on the product card that it was sign of genuine leather but who wants marks on their new wallet).
And it was way too costly than other wallets
The Size of the wallet was Very large.
There were only 2 Good Things
RFID Protection ( I have not checked that but company claim it)
Too Many Pockets
There will be no problem in keeping things like Cash,Coins, Bank Cards, Business Cards,Passes Etc."
3,OKAY,Quality is top notch. But its huge size is at disadvantage. If you are not used to bulky wallets then its definitely not you. it will be very uncomfortable in your pockets.
3,Nice product,
3,Poor,Poor
3,Loose it's colour,It is a good product but it starts to loose colour within a month.
3,This wallet,"It was OK
I was not satisfied
I gifted to my brother
Not worthy"
3,"Sufficient slots and pockets, but difficult to fold the wallet if you use all these slots.","The material is good, but as the surface is like sued leather, with use it will turn ugly due to friction with pocket. If all pockets are filled with cards and cash, the wallet is difficult to fold. It would have been better if it was provided with a strap to keep the wallet folded."
3,Product is good,Product is good
3,Not that great product !,A soft one where u need to handle delicately else it may tear off. No that a great one. And much value for money. Could satisfy your use for few months if handled with great care.
3,Price is so high,Value for money only 250
3,Nice,Overall this is nice product. I am satisfied. Product quality is not very good but it's ok.

3,Its good,"its good but some usage later the colour just fades into a dark material , also the material can also cause scratches hard to explain but check the images"
3,,
3,Not satisfied,Not satisfied
3,Bad stitching,"Its a good product with genuine build quality. But inside cloth is badly stiched and was teared with 15 days of usage, the cloth behind the card holder just got ripped and now I'm unable to use 3 of card holders..... I buyed this product specially for holding my cards and now I can hold only 3.. was expecting more from this product"
3,A very fat wallet.,The quality is good but the wallet is thick which I very visible to other people and doesn't look good if you carry it in a jeans pocket.

3,Terrible colour difference between product photo and original piece,"Play Video
 What's wrong with you Amazon?! Ok your product shots are great and photo editors are doing a fantastic job - FOR YOU! For the customer like me, it's just ike being taken for a ride. The wallet here shows a cool green colour which was one reason for the purchase of the product and in real have a look (everyone please) the sheer difference. You can't get away with a disclaimer for this. It's just not the product I was promised."
3,Value for money but.....,Licence and other I'd card doesn't fit.. only money can fit inside
3,Not a pocket friendly,Pocket me rkhne se jaldi kharab hojayega. Coz material usi trh ka h k thoda b pasina lgte hi utni side dhabba hojata hai
3,Average product,Liked it's material but the color as shown in image get's faded away within few days....and it goes dark dis color but leather finish and product is worth it in this price but the people who will buy for color pls keep in mind that color get's faded away
3,Not as expected but nice,The material is poor but worth buying
3,"Fake colour, not received as demonstrated.",Product colour is totally different then mentioned one tried for replacement but got same colour. It means they have did photoshop on product catalogue so it can look more elegant & cool. Product now become Harden day by day like an very old leather but i have purchased it just last month.
3,Credit card slots,The slots provided for keeping are too small. You have to struggle to insert the cards in the respective slots. Cards of some banks are slightly longer than others. These cards will not even enter the slots provided for the purpose. Think about this aspect before buying.
3,Color,Color changes in a month i bought blue color now its turning in black üòÑüòÑ quality is good make you color choice
3,Good but not satisfying,This product is good but the colour is not satisfying. When i received this product this was looking as it was used after using for few days it looked that its shine is gone and turned from green to black
3,An average product,"The material is good in the area of hardness and durability so far.
But the colour has no guarantee.
And due to press button in it, my ATM card got damaged."
3,Material is good but bulky,"My husband says it‚Äôs bulky, due to extra flap. Quality and look is classy. I don‚Äôt recommend if man is keeping it in back pocket"
3,Quality is good,Quality is good.but I don't like it
3,An OVERPRICED but okay item,"It gives an impression as if it should be soft premium leather but it's NOT! Between Rs 400 and 500, the item is overpriced, to be honest. The price must be around Rs 200."
3,Good Product But there occurred a change in colourüòÇ,"I have ordered a blue wallet, but I got a green one..
I think the packing agents should use a power glass..
The product is good, no doubt, but this colour will be horrible for this model..
I think its better to have a replacement."
3,colour or texture loss within 2 days .,very bad look after 2day use.
3,Colour Not exactly in image, Really my purchase interest created by the colour of the purse but when product received colour is not impressive to me. I rated 3 star out of 5.
3,good,good
3,not value for money,"it began to develop a dark patches, an ugly look after a regular use of 5 to 6 months. some fungal like things are seen in the non touching area of the purse. am not satisfied."
3,Nice but hard,"Colour is nice

Febric is little hard ..."
3,Not Original Leather,The product is not of genuine leather. The chain in the wallet doesnot hold it's teeth firmly.
3,Too bulky,It is a good quality purse. But it is really bulky. I would have preferred a much smaller purse. Of course it has the space to accommodate all your things.
3,Item looks good but Colour has changed after a month,Item looks good but color has changed after a month
3,Color change,After some days change to the colors
3,Color changed in one month,Color changed in one month

3,Colour of product is different from the shown image,
3,Quality is not upto the mark,Design is quite good..but quality slightly not good
3,Average product,Not much better if u search option of leather .
3,Average one,"Not so good leather quality,but it has got enough compartments to store cards and stuff.
And the size is too big,don't keep it in your back pocket while riding,sure you'll get back pain.
It'll cost around 500 bucks
If you add up 300 bucks more you'll get better and slimmer wallet."
3,Packaging,I have no complain about the product but the packaging was the worst I have ever seen. It wasn't even covered at all. It was just a single piece of paper on the front side of the product.
3,Don't go for blue color.,"I bought a blue color wallet, this is the color of product after 1 month of use. Otherwise overall quality is good."
3,All card slots not usable. Quite bulky,"Our of 9 card slots, only 5 can be used.
Even If 2 cards and few paper currency is kept in the wallet, it is quite thick.
Number of compartments provided is good. Material is good. I have doubt on thr stitching quality, as it is a single line stich. Color difference is expected as it is leather."
3,nice quality but a bit expensive,Better than those available in the shops
3,First impression,"The colour is darker than see in the picture. I expected it to look vibrant and stand out. The card slots or not the right size for basic cards, you'll have to cut it a little to fit the cards."
3,Not good in usability,"After keeping the credit cards , the wallet is too bulky....Can't put in pocket...Not able to use....Material seems good anyway..."
3,"Overall, Unsatisfactory!",Great quality but misleading in appearance. The colour received isn‚Äôt appealing at all. Disappointed.
3,Not scalp fresh,stay out

3,Good quality,Good quality
2,Card slot size,Card slot is very small
2,Not durable,It‚Äôs been only a month using the wallet and it has turned out like shown in the photo .. it is not durable and sturdy. Disappointed by the product.
2,Card Slot Useless,Card slots are too small. U can't insert cards. If u have 1 or 2 cards u can insert them forcefully in the first layer of slots. 2nd & 3rd layers total waste. Wallet looks good only for currency & coins.
2,Nice,Good
2,Not value for money,Not good at all
2,Letters Wallet,"This product is not best because of Amazon site
Seen the wallet is colourful and actual product is not colour best"
2,Not good,"Low quality material (other than the leather - the cloth and net kind of stuff which makes up the partitions), which got torn within 6 months of usage.

Bulky, that even the empty wallet is larger than most of the wallets available in the market, full of items.

Easily gets dirty, and unable to clean.

Bought this wallet as my 5 year old wallet started getting slight scratches in the leather. After 6 months of normal usage and another 6 months of usage with super glue and duct tape of this one, I went back to my 5 year old wallet. Wouldn't recommend this product at all."
2,Rust,All the atm card got rusted
2,Card case is worst,The purse doesn't fit cards and the card case is so big and uncomfortable to move around with
2,Good but not worth it,Good but quality is low. As shown in image. Please decrease the rate. Because the price not worth the product.

2,Not a good quality product,Real product is absolutely different than image shown in Amazon. Did not liked it.
2,Worst product dont buy,This wallet is the worst wallet i havee used till date and will not recomment anyone to buy this one as the color and suade lether on the outer body got damaged within a span of a week.
2,Don't buy,Colour faded in one week and material was not also good
2,Quality is good but tan color not as shown in picture,Quality is good but wallet color is not as such shown in picture.
2,Color faded,I had ordered this to gift my husband for his birthday and he loved it but it's not a month and the color got faded looks horrible now... Waste of money

2,Not,Not nice
2,Too big to fit for shirts from known brands,"It is overall good. But doesn't fit the front pockets of shirts from brand's like Raymond's, Allen, Peter Eng, etc."
2,Intially it is good upto 1 year but later the colour fades and it's bulky,I used this wallet for around 2 years and what I noticed is that the wallet gradually lost is colour intial days it was shiny and good looking and iam not a heavy user as well and the purse forcefully puts in my pocket beacuse it's bulky but the quality is good and i know it doesn't tear even after 5 years
2,It is not good,Bad product
2,Color not good," Color is dull it's look like already used product
I want my refund"
2,Stitching is very poor,Stitches are very bad outside leather is good but inside cloth not worth and not good
2,Just ok,"Play Video
 The quality of leather is not up to the mark. This quality can be purchased from local market at lesser price. The packaging is good and giftable. I guess that is the money they are taking for."
2,Stich quality not good,My wallet inner stitch is unstitched its open from 2 sides within 2 months
2,Very small pockets,Look was good but too small pockets to even hold cards
2,Quality is not good,Colour faded away after few days
2,Poor quality product with lots of separate compartment,"Material is not good as I was expecting. This wallet is having separate pockets for keeping cash, cards and coins. But, After 15 days of use the color changed and has faded a lot and now it looks like an old wallet."
2,Very bad üëé quality of this Wildhorn blue hunter wallet., Very bad üëé quality of this Wildhorn blue hunter wallet. I am use this wallet two day this very dirty. It looks like many years using this wallet üò≥ so please don't buy this wallet choos other colors
2,Wallet,Amazing products
2,Bad mitiriyal,Bad
2,"Think before you buy, good but not great:/","The colour of the product is good, however there are certain things you might wanna consider.
Since there are so many card slots and coin pocket, the wallet is pretty thick by itself so by adding cash or coins it is just going to become thicker and unattractive
Also wildhorn has published its name in alot of places in the wallet which kind of ruins the overall aesthetic"
2,Sangeeth,Colour faded don't prefer olive green just choose brown or black it's better
2,may damage your cards,"if you insert 9+2 cards to fill all provided card slots, it can't be folded. if you fold it forcefully it may damage your cards if kept for long time. put more 5 coins + 10-15 curruncy notes wallet can't be folded. see pics. otherwise wallet is good. if you have 1 or 2 cards only and keep less curruncy notes.... go for it."
2,"It is bulky , you want the wallet to be slim . It is not","It is bulky , you want the wallet to be slim . It is not."
2,Wait to give rating,It‚Äôs absorbing sweat after absorbing sweat it‚Äôs colour was change to black it‚Äôs not good to use
2,Material not good,The material was not good and the softness of the material was gone the next day itself.
2,Not expected,Not expected
2,"Very Big Wallet, Doesnt fit the pocket.",Where world is going for compact this is a huge bulgy wallet tht doesnt even let you sit. If you wear formal trousers it will hardly fit the pocket. Though the material quality is good this isnt something I would go for unless you have huge chunky pockets to fit this monstrocity.
2,Quality of Wallet.," See how the colour of wallet becomes, green to black this is review after 2 to 3 months. Wallet colour turns black and very cheap material is used to make that wallet as you can watch in video. And inside wallet dust goes easily and again wallet becomes black inside.."
2,Card slots are small,"I ordered hunter blue. I expected the colour would be somewhat teal, as it appeared like it in the picture. It looked an olive colour to me. It's hard and awkwardly big. The card slots can't accommodate a standard size business card. There are ample numbers of compartments. 2k bills can fit in. The material is synthetic leather."
2,Not worth it,It's spacious and feels & looks good at first but after using for 1-2 weeks it's became very loose and cheap looking
2,Okkkkk,Okkkk
2,Too big,Quality felt okay but the wallet is huge. Not ideal for everyone.
2,Not fulfilling its purpose,In the product I noticed 2 different colours on two different sides of purse won‚Äôt be good for long run can‚Äôt stack more than 5 cards of any type

Thought that they will be able to deliver quality as promised on the site. What I have received is rather a poor imitation of what's on the product page. Most important reason for the purchase is the looks that the product page promised which is completely different from what I have received. Being an Indian we're to help a fellow Indian company but if can't meet the set expectation we will loose business from out own people.

4,Accurate and Convenient,"In today's fast-paced world, having a reliable digital weighing scale at hand is essential for various purposes. Whether it's for measuring ingredients while cooking, monitoring your weight for health goals, or weighing luggage before a trip, a good digital weighing scale can make your life easier. In this review, we will explore the key features and benefits of digital weighing scales.

Accurate Measurements:
One of the primary advantages of digital weighing scales is their accuracy. Unlike traditional analog scales, digital scales provide precise measurements, often with decimal point accuracy. This level of precision is particularly useful when monitoring weight loss or gain, ensuring you can track progress more effectively.

Easy-to-Read Display:
Digital scales feature clear and easy-to-read displays, usually in the form of an LCD or LED screen. The weight is displayed prominently, making it convenient to read even in low-light conditions. Some scales may offer additional features, such as backlighting or larger display sizes, further enhancing visibility.

Multiple Units and Conversions:
Digital weighing scales commonly offer multiple unit options, allowing you to measure weight in various units such as pounds, kilograms, ounces, or grams. This versatility is beneficial for users around the world who may be accustomed to different unit systems. Additionally, many scales can easily convert between different units, saving you the hassle of manual calculations.

Tare Functionality:
Another useful feature found in digital scales is the tare function. This feature enables you to place a container or object on the scale and reset the measurement to zero, allowing you to measure only the weight of the desired item. It is especially helpful when cooking or when you need to subtract the weight of packaging material or containers.

Compact and Portable:
Digital weighing scales are often designed to be compact and lightweight, making them easy to store and carry. Their portability is particularly valuable for frequent travelers who want to weigh their luggage to avoid excess baggage fees. You can conveniently slip them into your suitcase or carry-on bag without taking up much space or adding significant weight.

Durability and Build Quality:
Modern digital scales are typically constructed using sturdy materials such as tempered glass or durable plastic, ensuring their longevity and resistance to daily wear and tear. It's essential to choose a scale with a robust build quality to ensure its reliability and accuracy over time.

Conclusion:
Digital weighing scales provide accurate and convenient measurements for a variety of purposes, from monitoring personal weight to measuring ingredients in the kitchen or weighing luggage. With their precise readings, easy-to-read displays, multiple unit options, tare functionality, and portability, digital scales offer a reliable solution for your weighing needs. When choosing a digital weighing scale, consider factors such as accuracy, build quality, additional features, and customer reviews to find the best fit for your requirements."

3,Digital scale,Expensive for the product delivered
5,Great product,"It's ergonomically designed and, most important, does its job well.

And, allowing it to be linked up to a smartphone such that the scale can ring an alarm and be found when the user is rushing to pack his luggage and has forgotten at the last minute where he stored the scale, could be another very helpful feature."
5,Small and nice,"Battery üîã life is good for more then a year at least, can last up to 3 yrs depending on your usage, small n compact and with a travel pouch easy to carry in ur pocket in size, display is very bright and can also be seen easily under the sun üòé, accurate in showing the weight.

5,Does it's job prefectly,"Exact weight accuracy.

I would suggest to add 0.5kg to the shown weight.
It little tough to handle for weight more than 40kg"
5,Portable Weighing machine,"I liked the packaging from manufacturer. it was neatly packed, all necessary seal which we think was there. Box contains the instructions which can be read beforehand operating the equipment. The instruction was short and easily understandable, Button size battery already included. Buyers can change the unit of weight such as Kg, lb by using power button. LED digits are so clear to recognise the exact value. You get the display that show character hold when you steadily holding the weight machine, that value can be measured. Weight gauge in mostly looks accurate as they using some sensors. So totally worth using this portable one especially for travellers it can be very useful."

5,excellent digital weight scale for luggage,"Play Video
 I looked at several luggage scales before I decided on this one. It is exactly what I was looking for, easy to use, small but you don't need a magnifying glass to read the scale results, and very portable. It comes with clear, not cryptic instructions. It won't take up much room in your suitcase, carry on or purse.and it was an excellent price. I am very pleased with this purchase and expect to get much use out of it.
Pros:
1. Strong and sturdy made of stainless steel top and ABS plastic bottom. This ensures it does not break when using heavy weights. We tried it with 6,15 and 25 kg weights and it was perfect. For heavier weight you need to keep the hand stable and hold with both hands to get the right weight. I attach videos to demo this.
2. Lightweight
3. Pocket size so you can carry everywhere easily. I don‚Äôt need to worry about excess baggage on return flights now !
4. Smart and sleek design with quality branding.
5. Nice packaging
6. Simple to follow instructions in the manual.
7. Rich in features - auto off, low battery indicator, multiple units of measure, which is useful in international travel.
8. Backlight for clear visibility in low light.
9. Most importantly, accurate weight measurements. But airline scales can be different so l always like to keep some buffer.
10. Value for money at this price
11. Once stable weight is reached it locks itself.

Cons:
For heavier weights, it is difficult to hold the luggage steady and hence weight lock takes more time. But that is a small issue which can be bypassed by keeping slight buffer.
Other than that no issues so far."

It's saved me from unexpected baggage fees and the hassle of repacking at the airport. The metal construction feels sturdy, and it's become a trusted travel companion. I highly recommend it to fellow travelers for a stress-free journey."
5,Great product,"It's ergonomically designed and, most important, does its job well. Wish Bharat could start producing similar products... maybe with added features such as AI-enabled voice readouts in a choice of languages? ;-) Making it solar-powerable (besides battery-operable) might be another innovation. And, allowing it to be linked up to a smartphone such that the scale can ring an alarm and be found when the user is rushing to pack his luggage and has forgotten at the last minute where he stored the scale, could be another very helpful feature."
5,Small and nice,"Battery üîã life is good for more then a year at least, can last up to 3 yrs depending on your usage, small n compact and with a travel pouch easy to carry in ur pocket in size, display is very bright and can also be seen easily under the sun üòé, accurate in showing the weight.

I would suggest to add 0.5kg to the shown weight.
It little tough to handle for weight more than 40kg"
5,Portable Weighing machine,"I liked the packaging from manufacturer. it was neatly packed, all necessary seal which we think was there. Box contains the instructions which can be read beforehand operating the equipment. The instruction was short and easily understandable, Button size battery already included. Buyers can change the unit of weight such as Kg, lb by using power button. LED digits are so clear to recognise the exact value. You get the display that show character hold when you steadily holding the weight machine, that value can be measured. Weight gauge in mostly looks accurate as they using some sensors. So totally worth using this portable one especially for travellers it can be very useful."

4,Accurate and Convenient,"In today's fast-paced world, having a reliable digital weighing scale at hand is essential for various purposes. Whether it's for measuring ingredients while cooking, monitoring your weight for health goals, or weighing luggage before a trip, a good digital weighing scale can make your life easier. In this review, we will explore the key features and benefits of digital weighing scales.

Accurate Measurements:
One of the primary advantages of digital weighing scales is their accuracy. Unlike traditional analog scales, digital scales provide precise measurements, often with decimal point accuracy. This level of precision is particularly useful when monitoring weight loss or gain, ensuring you can track progress more effectively.

Easy-to-Read Display:
Digital scales feature clear and easy-to-read displays, usually in the form of an LCD or LED screen. The weight is displayed prominently, making it convenient to read even in low-light conditions. Some scales may offer additional features, such as backlighting or larger display sizes, further enhancing visibility.

Multiple Units and Conversions:
Digital weighing scales commonly offer multiple unit options, allowing you to measure weight in various units such as pounds, kilograms, ounces, or grams. This versatility is beneficial for users around the world who may be accustomed to different unit systems. Additionally, many scales can easily convert between different units, saving you the hassle of manual calculations.

Tare Functionality:
Another useful feature found in digital scales is the tare function. This feature enables you to place a container or object on the scale and reset the measurement to zero, allowing you to measure only the weight of the desired item. It is especially helpful when cooking or when you need to subtract the weight of packaging material or containers.

Compact and Portable:
Digital weighing scales are often designed to be compact and lightweight, making them easy to store and carry. Their portability is particularly valuable for frequent travelers who want to weigh their luggage to avoid excess baggage fees. You can conveniently slip them into your suitcase or carry-on bag without taking up much space or adding significant weight.

Durability and Build Quality:
Modern digital scales are typically constructed using sturdy materials such as tempered glass or durable plastic, ensuring their longevity and resistance to daily wear and tear. It's essential to choose a scale with a robust build quality to ensure its reliability and accuracy over time.

Conclusion:
Digital weighing scales provide accurate and convenient measurements for a variety of purposes, from monitoring personal weight to measuring ingredients in the kitchen or weighing luggage. With their precise readings, easy-to-read displays, multiple unit options, tare functionality, and portability, digital scales offer a reliable solution for your weighing needs. When choosing a digital weighing scale, consider factors such as accuracy, build quality, additional features, and customer reviews to find the best fit for your requirements."

4,great product!!! best accuracy.,great product!!! best accuracy.

4,Good but could be better,"When u lift the heavy bags up, the reading never ever stabilises. Would have been good if it displayed the average weight atleast"
4,Good product,Good product..provides close to accurate information unlike other chinese products in the market
4,It's quite accurate.,Elegant and easy to use
4,Quality product. Purchase this,"I ordered 2, this one and Amazon basics. The amazon basics one is really bad in front of this. I had to return that bcoz they sent me used and scratched refurbished item instead of new one. I don't know why people scratch if they've to that return item. Anyways, I'm ordering 2nd one from bcoz first impressions are pretty good.

This one has bigger bar as compared to other model which makes it easy to lift weights. I only hope it works for long term.

Quality and ease of use is really good. Given 4 star only bcoz of 2 things:
1) Putting and removing battery is not easy. It's pretty tight unlike Amazon basics model.
2) The units kg/lb has to be selected immediately after turning the device on, not later unlike other models which you can change even while lifting the weight. But it's only a small issue bcoz I always measure in kgs.

Great thing is, they've given a nice pouch. Tho warranty is not mentioned anywhere, but on packaging they mention that we can contact them if we're unhappy. Overall, you can blindly purchase this quality product."
4,Perfect for traveling,"*Got it for 799
*Faster delivery
*Got one handy pouch too"
4,Good,Great
4,Perfect companion,"It is best one , go for it without having second thought about it"
4,Easy to use but slightly smaller handle which reduces grip for heavy items,It serves the purpose and quite accurate. Just the length of handle to hold the weight is little smaller. Longer handles would help with proper grip for heavier items which takes 2 hands to hold.
4,Good on this price,Light weight and handy. Hope this lasts longer
4,Adding my review after using for 2 yrs,"Most valuable product which has perfect digital to measure weight.
-worth it.
product i bought on : 2020
review date: 2022,oct."
4,Good product but a bit expensive,I got a used product initially. Then I requested for a replacement and got a fresh new one in 3 days time. The device looks premium and sturdy. But I think the price could have been a bit lower. Need to test the accuracy for the equipment later when I go to the airport.
4,Accurate,"Good product.
They can use AAA battery instead of one provided.

AAA batteries are easily available around the world."
4,good,easy to use and easy to view the weight
4,Ok product.,Ok product.
4,"Good, but it's not all metal",The top part is metal but the bottom part which touches your hand is plastic and does not look very durable.
4,Good product!,"Good product, except for the strap for weighing."
4,Good,Like
4,Handy product if u r frequent traveller,"It‚Äôs a handy WFM product
Accuracy is nearly same for Airport scale"
4,Does the job accurately,Does the job accurately. It was a nice gift for my folks.
4,Value for money and Quite Accurate,"Good product, Weighs baggage quite accurately. The only problem is the device is little small to hold on to steadily when you are weighing baggage which are 15+ kgs, the reading keeps fluctuating, but approximately you can determine the weight, which when measured at the check-in counter was within limit. Just make sure you are 1 kg within the baggage weight limit specified by Airline."
4,Good,"Handy, easy to use and carry."
4,Delivery was as schedule.,Just used for a day. Can comment after a month or so. Appears to be close to accurate.
4,Very light weight and Accurate,"It is high precision. But sometimes shows some numbers on screen even without putting any weight. The tear functionality is really well thought through. It can measure even 50 gms. It also shows different weight units e.g. KG, Gm, Lb(pound) so, very useful for international travel. Very lightweight to carry with you."
4,About Product,Very useful to abroad traveling people
4,Useful ..,Useful .. accurate up to 90 per cent.
4,Brilliant measuring tool,"Good product. Accurate measurement.

I have a small business and I have to place parcel for delivery. The measurement that was given to me by this product was the same that was in the courier company measuring tool. There was no difference at all. I really liked it as it gives accurate measurement."
4,good,good one. the hook could have been bigger
4,Good qlty,Can carry good amount of weight
4,Practical,"Foremost thanks for delivering within 18 hours, ordered 2pm and delivered 8am with a flight to catch at 4pm. Sleek and accurate with a lovely pouch.
Hope unlike the other chinese scales, this one will serve more than a year.."
4,Easy to use,It's easy to use and accuracy level is better
4,Super,Excellent
4,No battery...I consider it as incomplete kit,"No battery....do not prefer to go out for shopping, so we opt amazon....it's very disappointing to not get the full package....what's the point if we have to go out to buy something to make the kit complete and then use??"
4,Meets the purpose..but..,If the bag is heavy..it‚Äôs challenging to lift with the scale.
4,fantastic product from utility point for the people who travel abroad with family.,"This was the product I was imagining since long as every time while going on foreign trips we found difficulties in weighing the bags. we use to use body weighing scales but not correct way as bags are big and can't read the scale properly. so this is the best unit.

While on the above I gave one star less on overall rating as recommend you to thing and supply one nice small cloth or artificial pouch to store this unit. That would be a nice gesture for customer satisfaction from the supplier's end."
4,Great for luggage weight management,"The scale is accurate and great foe travelling, especially the design that allows you to read the weight easily. However, given a small size the tool fluctuates and moves while you hold it and it can be difficult to know exact weight."
4,Not so accurate,It is easy to use. Good build quality. However the reading is not so accurate. It is showing a 5% variance.
4,Useful product for Baggage check during Travel,Handy and easy to use.
4,Just perfect,It‚Äôs as I wish exactly
4,Good,But the price is little expensive. other than it is good. Travel friendly with a pouch in it. I like it. i can't guarantee the strap for how long it will last. For now it is Good.
4,Made my life easier,I often travel abroad and every time i have to switch from domestic to international where the weight allowance is totally different. hence this scale is almost accurate and made my life easier in transit.
4,Fairly Accurate and stylish,"Very smart design. Easy to use. Highly recommend buying it.
For confirming Accuracy will have to weigh different objects and check.
Weighed 2 different bags of supposed to be 5 kgs each- 1 showed as 5.3 kg and the other 4.75 kg."
4,Nice product,Good build. Overall an awesome product. Would have been more convenient if it supported AAA size batteries.
4,very useful and handy,very useful material. Very easy to handle
4,received it in good Packaging with Button Cell.,"I tried it out by weighing a pre weighed packet of 0.5 kg
the scale showed me reading on 0.53 kg which is much better.
as of now its seems very good, will have to see after some time weather it needs recallibration or not.
hope review is useful to others."
4,Very good,Value added product. Satisfied.
4,Good product,Good product.
4,If only there was a way to hang it and use.,Not everyone and everytime can you lift a 20kg bag with the help of one hand.
4,Easy to handle and comfortable to use,Much comfortable product
4,Good portable weight scale product.,Difference of weight between 400 to 500 grams should be considered. Product is good.
4,Good product to buy,Very useful in travel especially during air travel. It measures almost accurately. Only negative is we have to hold by two hands for proper reading.
4,Accurate and compact,"Near accurate product.. good features. Needs only cr2032 battery compared to 2xaaa batteries. Compact product..
Accurate result comes only when u are able to hold with steady hands."
4,Working fine so far.,Using occassionally. Its working and good so far.
4,"Good durable product to buy, high price","Good product to buy, high price, top metal easily catch scratches, hold function doesn‚Äôt last more then 2 seconds, bit tricky by the time you keep the baggage it‚Äôs gone."
4,IT'S GOOD SO FAR,I used this Machine 3 times after purchasing and it correctly weighed my baggage with a difference of 0.5 gm. It's very good until now. Let's hope it continues like this in future too.
4,Serves my purpose; must have while travelling,It gives quite an accurate weight and is easy to use. Quite reliable.
4,Good for home use.,"Quality product, assuming it's close to accuracy because no complaints yet, not sure if it's good for weighing baggages for flights but on the whole, better than weighing scale and easy to use."
4,Good Product,For weighing the luggage especially for air travel. The reading is almost accurate
4,A good travel companion.,A compact and great value for money product for accurate measurements.
4,Great product,"Easy to use,well designed. Sleek and stylish."
3,Not so good not so bad,Most of the time shows correct results but sometimes need to recalibrate.
3,Digital scale,Expensive for the product delivered
3,Not 100% accurate,"It gives you an approx weight, not 100% accurate, cannot rely on this while travelling"
3,The build material is good.,It gives an accuracy of around 90 percent.
3,Nice product,"Hook is very small, need to be make convenient for handling the luggage"
3,It's handy and accurate if it works,"I bought 2 pieces in December2022, one works fine and the other was opened recently and it just keeps showing error."
3,Nice Product to use,"I weighted the Laguage bags multiple times.. on average the weight is showing correct.

Disadvantage:
Only single battery given. its better to provide minimum 2-3 batteries , then only can be used for long time.
We can't buy these small batteries outside"
3,Average product,"It worked for one time only. I had kept the battery separate so that it does not damage the product. Tried fixing the battery - not working. The light does not switch on. Also there is a warranty card that needs to be registered within one month which I have not seen or done. I don't understand why it needs to be registered if the seller has sold his product and it has been bought.
The customer service is excellent as they have offered to refund even after so many days, hence I have increased the rating. The product is working now after I changed the battery. Hope it works after I remove the battery when I am not using it"
3,Great but over expensive. Fake warranty claim,"Accurate, easy to use but makes fake warranty claims, product comes with 1 yr warranty as opposed to claimed 5 yrs. No where written on package.
Over expensive. These are standard chinese bulk products. Other companies sell the exact same thing cheaper."
3,Nice product,Accurate
3,Not suitable for large luggage,"The product is ideal for small pieces of luggage or light bags, not for medium/large or heavy suitcases. If you‚Äôre weighing bags you are carrying for travel, it‚Äôs likely they‚Äôre a bit heavier and that‚Äôs why you want to be sure you‚Äôre within the limit. For such bags (I‚Äôm talking about 20+ kgs and bags that are medium sized, checked in with the airlines) this product is virtually unusable. It‚Äôs so small that you can‚Äôt reliably hold your luggage steady until the weight reading calibrates. There was a variance of 4-8 kgs every time we tried it with multiple large bags, which is not a reasonable amount of buffer to maintain. Probably useful for carry on, where the total weight is usually 7-8 kg but not for larger or heavier luggage."
3,Reliability issue,Handy but not reliable for accuracy.
3,Battery,Battery life discharged quickly
3,Handy but not accurate.,This device is handy and easy to use. But not giving the right weight. Varience around -1 Kg. Checked with two 23 Kg luggages. The given weight is less while compared with Airport scale. Due to this we left some goods for the trip.
3,Unsatisfactory,"Play Video
 It is malfunctioning even after replacing battery refer upload and replace the product urgently as we are going to travel in a week from today 15/10/2022."
3,little expensive from the market.,"this products has good features, always nice to carry while travelling. little expensive from the markets compare to other same products avialable. it is quite good looking and also looks stylish."
3,Best product, It is good product
3,Not in a sealed box,The product was not in a sealed box. The battery was also out of the packaging and inserted in the scale. Otherwise the functionality part is good
3,How to remove battery and replace new one,No instruction on how to remove and replace battery as the battery is not getting removed
3,Costly!,Just because of marketing this device is way costlier than it's cunterparts. There's nothing inside except a peizoelectric crystal. Rest all is gimmick. So no point of charging this much!
3,Underwhelming experience,"The material is not good to touch at all. May be it not suited for Indian weather which is hot and humid. There is a sticky feel on touch.
The product itself has a good ergonomics which is suited aptly to weigh luggages.
What was most disappointing is the battery they provide. On my first use it showed 'LO'. I mean come on either put a good quality cell (it cost rs 40 at max?) Or don't provide a battery at all so that buyers can order it seperately. With this kind of packaging buyers will have trust issue about the seller."
3,Not Metal,"This weigh scale is not of metal as mentioned in the title, just the colour is metallic. It is made of plastic. 2 stars less for the deceptive description.

Weight accuracy is good and easy to use and carry."
3,Good but it's very difficult for big baggage as they said (upto 50kg),Good but it's very difficult for big baggage as they said (upto 50kg)
3,"Old Cell, not working","Had to buy a new cell to use the equipment. The cell provided is old and totally discharged. Also, the cell was not in a sealed condition. Three stars due to this reason"
3,Battery wasn't included,"Battery wasn't included as mentioned in the description. Apart from that, it's fine."
3,Accurate for smaller objects,"Accurate for smaller weights only. as you try to weigh heavier objects, the accuracy decreases significantly. I weighed my lpg cylinder and it gave reading of 27kg, while the actual weight was around 31kg (which I checked on two other scales)."
3,Battery not included,Received the product with no battery
3,Ok ok,"Gives you a very wage idea
Very difficult to hold firmly without movement"
3,"Good scale, discharges battery shipped","The scale is good, however, the battery shipped with the product was discharged. If you can‚Äôt send a working battery, please don‚Äôt write that it‚Äôs included."
3,There is a bit difference if weight if you compare with airport weighing scale..,It's ok for estimation purposes.
3,Required strength to accurately measure high weights (above 20kgs).,"Easy for low weights (upto 15 kgs).
Gets tougher above 15kgs as you need to hold the luggage for longer periods for the scale to stabilize."
3,"Product good, but delivered a used pc","It's user friendly. Switched on in an instant , as and when weight increases, the percentage of error is high.
I received a damaged , opened package , which is not fair . Planning to return
Photos attached"
3,Inaccurate,It is all about showing accuracy which it does not fulfill at all. So completely useless for the travellers..
3,Good one,"Nice product only , it's working properly
Weight lifting components should be more desirable ,add one more lifting mechanism"
3,Good Quality,Quality & Accuracy
3,Accuracy not good for below 1kg.,"100 +- Graham veriation and below 1kg accuracy not good.
0.000 required but available 0.00 only 2digits."
3,Not really a great deal,Product is OK! But price keep on changing and main thing is no battery inside. Do u guys thinking we need to go shop and buy battery again.... Just a kind of irritating... Try to satisfy customers... I bought it for 768 few hours later it's 698... Don't know ur logic.
3,Doesn't show the accurate measurement.,Measurement accuracy.
3,Very nice use for air travel.,All most.
3,Not accurate for heavy weights ~20 Kg +,"Since it depends on the stability of the grip , the figures are not accurate for heavy weights"
3,Worth it,Doesn't work as efficiently the weight in any unit doesn't indicate the same value everytime-its weight is definitely not exact and we have to hold it in angle it expects to work and not comfortable to hold or to measure but looks and feels is worth it.
3,SUPER,good product easy to use
3,Pricy,Good product but overpriced
3,Cumbersome to use,Not easy to measure even medium size bags
3,Wouldn't recommend for ladies,It's not convenient to weigh suitcases. Especially for ladies to weigh luggage with this instrument is difficult. Accuracy wise it's good.
3,Does the job done handy for travelling.,The product is well built but price would be a value for more if priced under 500 or 600 rupees.
3,Uts a good product,"The only thing i didnt liked about it is the steel hook or strap given to hold the weight
Like its Not that useful
Like i dont know how to describe it
But overall the product is good"
3,It did not include the battery as mentioned i,Made it difficult to use
3,GoTrippen,There will be difference(0.1 to 0.5) in weight every time..
3,Good design and easy to use but with lighter weights show inconsistency in reading,Good design and easy to use but with weights less than 500 gms the readings weren't consistent.
3,Let alone accuracy,"Easy to use, portable though accuracy sucks"
3,Product is nice,Material quality of the Product is good but needs to improve Accuracy level
3,Nice premium look,Some time it's take time to become zero.
3,Overpriced,"it's good but not ""‚Çπ700 good""
feels overpriced"
3,It‚Äôs just okay not up to the mark,It‚Äôs okay device the accuracy varies always .
3,Normal,Normal
3,Smooth and easy,"Working smooth, but product I received seems old and used product even though the cover and packing all right,"

2,It should be easy to lift the baggage,It is very hard to hold the baggage with 20 kg
2,Not suitable for weighing travel luggage. It slips out and health hazardous especially for seniors,"It slips out of hand and very dangerous
It hurts the wrist"
2,Takes too long to give the final result!,"Takes a lot of time to give the final weight of the luggage. Moreover, the hook is not attached to the center of the main body which makes it uncomfortable to weigh a travel bag."
2,Not accurate at all,This item shows 1/2 kg more than actual wait. Funniest part is that even product manual says it‚Äôs not accurate. Don‚Äôt buy thinking it‚Äôs digital and hence this would be accurate
2,Not easy to handle,The product is useful only for weighing about 10 kgs. It is difficult to weigh more than 10 kgs luggage using hands as we cannot keep our hands steady with heavy weight to get accurate reading. Chinese make. Over priced. Battery missing in the pack though the carton states that battery is inside.
2,Carry bag luggage whaigh,"Very poor, not working properly."
2,No battery?,"Order arrived swiftly, good price but not as promised.

The product description includes a CR2032 battery but that was missing, so how do I use it when I travel tomorrow? Not impressed."
2,Not accurate value,Weight is showing not accurate value and not showing again same weight also. Outer glass material which is seem good. Leather hang is very good
2,Missing Battery,"Assumed battery was inside the package and did not check till my day of travel. Had to use friends scale. No battery inside package, which is disappointing
06 Mar2023 device stopped working. Changing the rating"
2,Not useful,"Don't know how it works, but it gives wrong result."
2,Battery was not included,"Battery was not included even though box said ""battery inside"" - apart from that product is working."
2,Battery is over after 5 mins of starting the product,"Battery is over after 5 mins of starting the product.. so couldn‚Äôt use at all during travel even though the purpose was to use it‚Ä¶
Have read a lot of reviews on the battery issue"
2,Not a value for money product,Very expensive and the quality is just ok. I think they're paying some of the money to fake reviewers.
2,Not 100% accurate,It's not 100% accurate. I noted a fluctuation of 2-3 kgs when I checked for 15kgs trolley.
2,If you want to check the weight more than 23 kg dont go for this model.,"The accuracy level is not correct all the time. I have reset this many times and checking the weight for 29 kg.But when i went to Bangalore airport its showing 32 kg.

Lifting 30 kg bag with this model is very tough and you will get hand pain within 2 min.

Even I separately done weighting all the items and calculated near.
Putting all together and checking weight is not showing the calculated one."
2,Good but not always accurate,Gud but not always accurate . Sometine 1kg some time 900gm also not work in 50gm
2,"Did Not get the Battery. Though It was Mentioned ""Battery Inside""","Though It was Mentioned ""Battery Inside"" I did not get the Battery."
2,No consistency. Shows different weight for the same product. Not reliable.,The product was used for weighing hand lugages for travel abroad.
2,Lgds,This product is good
2,Erratic measurements,Erratic and inaccurate
2,It doesn't work properly and everytime the reading is not the same for same weight.,For weighing luggage
2,Buy it if you want to weigh maximum 15 kgs. Holding and lifting more is difficult with this product.,I used this to weigh luggage. This is useful to use small compact bags. Difficult to weigh suitcases. I didn't find it worth the price.
2,Ok,Useful but Very delicate
2,Not so good. Failed to work after sometime. No helpline.,"Initially for 2-3 weighing it worked properly. But after that started showing error, weight in negative etc. It measured a laptop weight 18 kg. Even there is no helpline for these error to correct."
2,Fake Customer Care number,Product is authentic however considering warranty challenges had to return the product as their customer care number is now being used by some other manufacturer.
2,Looks good but not accurate,"Looks attractive, easy to use and nice bright LED display. However, not accurate in weight which is the main purpose of buying such a expensive weight machine. I tried weighing 5 ltr (4.55 KG) oil can, each time weight was different and off by 200 gms to 300 gms."
2,Not at all recommended,"wish I could give 0 for easy to use section as it is not at all easy to use, you need to first balance your product to weigh it"
2,Measurements vary a lot,Measurements differ a lot. Has a error margin 5-10%.
2,I received dead battery,I got dead battery
2,"premium built, but cant take weight over 20kgs","worked for first 2 bags, broke on the 3rd one..3rd bag weighed 21 kgs and the hook that connects the device came off"

1,The working quality of the product delivered is not good.,"The product when I opened its packing for use within 3 to 4 uses of it started showing wrong weight measures and it's nib of power cell got out of loose which is still not fitting well.
Very worst quality of working it has. I can't rate it even with a half star."
1,It was working fine until i checked a weight of 24kg,After checking a weight of 24 kg it‚Äôs started showing incorrect. Without any load it‚Äôs showing more than above 40kg some times its showing ‚Äòerror‚Äô.Such a waste product.
1,My device is Malfunctioning,"Play Video
 I ordered this Go tripin travel scale on the 11th of July, 2023, and was delivered on 14th July, 2023. Initially, l had plans to travel in August but canceled it so never used this scale until this month l'm ready to travel and the scale is malfunctioning. At the time of purchase, I fixed the battery in and tested it then and it came after which l removed battery and packed it. This is my first time of usage and the product is misbehaving. Please l need replacement right away and it's urgent!!"
1,Trippin digial weigh scale,"Never buy it, total waste of money. Recently bought it & now regretting. It failed on my third attempt to weigh my suitcase."
1,"overpriced and not sturdy,","Overprices and not durable, and no option to return"
1,Inaccurate reading,"This was my second purchase of the same product since I had misplaced the first one during my travels . However this time , the device gave inaccurate readings . Based upon the readings by the device , my baggage was exceeding by 9 kgs. So I had booked extra baggage prior to my departure. To my horror ‚Ä¶. My check in baggage and carry in baggage included weighed less than the permissible limit at the airport check in counter . I cannot not even return the faulty device because I have left for my trip and the window for return period will be over by the time I return from my trip . I had to chuck out a huge amount of money for inaccurate readings provided by the device. Very unhappy ."
1,Inaccurate number shown everytime,"Weighing scale is defective did not not work well, shows different kilos everytime you weigh the same thing"
1,"Display gone, after using 2 times.","The build quality is good, used it twice showed correct weight. Today 3rd time tried to use it no display.

Thought battery may have died out. Replaced battery, now the light glows but no display."
1,Readings are not accurate.,"Hi,
I have recently travelled from Vizag to Hyd and use the weighing scale to measure. It showed the weight as 15.5 kg where as in reality it was 18.5 kg. A clear and a signicifant difference. Waste of money. Plus the battery is not included in the package and also the battery rating is not mentioned."
1,Seems the product sold to me is used/returned,The battery given along with the product was open. Also there are finger print marks on the device it self. Since I was traveling the next day I don‚Äôt have time to return it. I used it to weigh my luggage and it works but not sure how long it will work‚Ä¶
1,Waste of money and time and all,If there is any negative Star rating then i would have chosen that one only. Bad bad and totally bad product and don't trust this one wasted my money and our time also. In home when we checked the weight it showed as 23+kgs only and we trusted that few grams won't effect us but when my brother that too first time he is going to other country got tensed when he checked the weight at ticket counter in airport it showed 28kgs stright away and we have to pay extra for that weight. If you are a first time traveller and that too student don't trust this product they designed this product as it will show upto 23+kgs only we blindly trust this one and later we have to get tensed and have to pay extra. And they don't take your product back so our money got wasted in all ways.
1,Product seems Good,"Warranty issue ,despite submitting invoice etc on WhatsApp as guided by company but ruthless and ridiculously demanding submitting review screen alongwith invoice etc ,without using the product no review can be given ,and pre- condition ,U receive categorical Message ur warranty can't be registered as u didn't not follow company's dictation.Amazon must take caution note of such arrogant attitude. üòÄ"
1,Worst of the worst product,"Worst of the worst product, do not recommend to anyone. Money waste"
1,Inconsistent readings,Gives inconsistent and inaccurate readings. Not suitable for 23/32 Kg bags.
1,It show error and not working,Poor performance
1,battery Down very fast,Totally wasted Money. It's taking too much battery. in a year 2 time I checked my luggage weight after that battery finished. Every time first buy bettery then check luggage.
1,wrong readings everytime,Shows wrong reading evertime even when the object is same. dont buy it. couldn't return it too
1,Received deffect item,"Showing wrong reading, not working properly"
1,Worst battery,"Battery drains frequently. Changed 3 batteries for few times usage. If u use it two times, u need to change the battery."
1,The scale is faulty and shows incorrect readings.,"Bought it to weigh my luggage for international travel. It's lightweight. At first, it gave almost accurate results for smaller things. Took my luggage to the airport and ended up paying $50 for the extra weight as the scale didn't show the correct reading and there was a huge difference between the actual reading and how much it showed on the scale. Contacted CS but I was asked to contact the manufacturer as it was outside the return window. I only used it 2-3 times. Very disappointed with the item."
1,Don't know which battery to use,No battery was given with it
1,Sensor not working,The weight is stuck at 0 kg not changing at all. The product is not working as expected.
1,Accuracy not perfect.,Somehow i like . Design is awesome but very poor product. Goal of product is zero.
1,Not working,Not working showing error on display
1,Very bad,Its not comvenient and very expensive compared to other good products.no options except on/off.
1,Bad battery compartment design,"Once I plugged in the battery, the device started to work. However removing the battery is extremely difficult due to bad design. When I removed and put in the cell again the 2nd time, the device stopped working even when there was no such visible damage.

I would suggest not to buy this product. The battery compartment is extremely flimsy and ill-designed. High chance that you might end up damaging the component and wiring when you try to replace a battery (and you wouldn't be able to tell whether its actually damaged) ."
1,Worst product - complete waste of money,One of the worst product ever. Bought it to weight luggage 2 days before flight. Used it for half a day and next day it showed low battery. Bought new battery and only last for 3 hours. Complete waste of money.
1,Worst service from Amazon,"Product is faulty and i ordered for replacement. Amazon didnt deliver the replacement product inspite of i getting a message that it is out of delivery. Not sure how worst Amazon can get for its delivery.

The product itself is faulty and do not give any reading. It just stucks at ""Err"" screen when you try to weight the luggage which is not even 5 kgs."
1,Didn‚Äôt last for even a few months.,The quality is not what you paid and expect it to be. All I can see is error on the screen. No support from vendor and Amazon too.
1,Good make. Inaccurate/unregistered readings below 5 kgs,"Is there a way to contact the customer service of this brand? I like the make of the product and how ergonomic it is, however when I had tried checking the weight of a few items below 5 kgs, the display keep shows it as 0. The response to weight above 5 kgs has been okay so far. as a digital scale, I don't expect such blunders and lack of readability. Could Amazon arrange a call from the company to me please?"
1,Worst product,It doesn't show the right weight. My luggage was 14 kgs and it was showing 23 kg.
1,Display is faulty.,I thought it‚Äôs a genuine product so didn‚Äôt bother to check if it‚Äôs working when I got it. I opened it after two weeks to weigh my bags and turned out that the display was faulty and now I do not have an option to send it back and it‚Äôs sitting in my cupboard. Junk and complete piece of trash. Buy from somewhere else save your self a trouble and money.
1,Worst product,"Giving incorrect weight after 2 months only, weight measure at home and at airport luggage counter was different by more than 4 kgs"
1,Weighing machine,"Got spoiled within a few months. As soon as you try to change the battery, it will stop working. Pathetic product. Don't know whether I can get the refund or not. Don't buy."
1,Not working product,The product doesn‚Äôt work and the quality of the product is too bad. After looking to the images and product description I thought this will be good product but unfortunately this is not. I would suggest not to buy this product.
1,Item Detective,Defective item. While weighing it either shows Error or 0.00 always. Waste of money.
1,No battery included,"The box says that there is battery inside, but not to be found anywhere. We have our flight tomorrow morning. We ordered this product because it was to arrive one day before we travel. Although the product arrived on time, still it is of no use to us now because it does not have battery inside. The device requires the rare 3V CR2032 battery, for which we will have to wait for shops to open tomorrow, and our flight will depart by the time we purchase the battery."
1,Most inaccurate,Lot of Weight difference of luggage between this machine and the ones at airport

1,Return,"Bought it in oct 2021. Used it just once ir twice to weigh my travel luggage. Not even an year., It doesn't work.
I'm traveling again but no weighing scale. Can they replace it?
How can a product work just for a week? The battery is fine though."
1,Waste of money, I used only one time this product. Not showing accurate weight it‚Äôs showing error. I will not recommend this product. Waste of time and money.
1,Suddenly stopped working after one use,Just after one use the luggage scale auddenly stopped working. And you get just a week replacement which makes it waste of money.
1,Can't rely on this product,When I got it from Amazon it was working fine. After few days when it tried it shows zero display only and it's 2 month old.
1,"Very inaccurate, don't go for it",This is one of the worst purchases I made on Amazon. The weight reading differs to a degree after each measurement of the same product. I got the replacement and new scale I got is behaving the same. I just missed return window yesterday. Now I'm stuck with this not-so-useful scale.
1,Don't buy it.,"The product was defective and there is no return possible for this. Replacement is possible but you are travelling in few days, you can't replace also. Last thing, replacement is possible only from the city where you purchased."
1,Its a worst product.,"Its a worst product. Its stopped working on 11 th day. And showing error. I have to weigh my travelling bagguage, but one day before my travelling date, its showing error.
I strongly recommend not buy such a bad product.
When I I tried to complain on given phone number, but it was wrong phone number printer on product's box.
Actually its a cheating."
1,DO.NOT.BUY...POOR quality,"This product worked only for 3 months post that it shows error. Though device in warranty, there is no contact details. Only one email ID email sent but no reply. .called Amazon customer care..they are saying Amazon is not responsible for warranty issue. So guys don't buy this product .!!!!!"
1,Useless weighing scale not accurate,Useless weighing scale.It's not accurate..for 22 kilos on this weighing it's 30 kilos in the airport weighing scale.its useless weighing scale.bi paid so much money for my excess baggage.regret buying this product & i can't return it
1,Waste of Money,"If you are planning to use it to weigh travell luggage then this is not the right product. You can weigh only up to 7-8 kg. Moment it crosses 12 kg, machine starts showing error. Absolute waste of money"
1,Stopped working after one week,"Wasted the money, don't buy"
1,Item DEAD in 6/8 uses,"The item is DEAD after 6 to 8 lifts. Changed the Cell, display shows 000, even with weight.
Supplier trying to fool customers ??
If you are a fraud, read this and forget. You are being a disgrace to Amazon.
If you are genuine and care for your reputation ant that of Amazon, , then donot hide behind the excuse of one month Warrany. Just replace it.
Thanks."
1,Device not working properly,"I was lifting around 5 -6kg trolly for that it shows ‚ÄòErr‚Äô
I tried taking out battery and restarted still the same

1,Not useful don't buy it.,Not useful to measure.
1,Bad product,It stopped working in less than two months. Shows the message ‚ÄúErr‚Äù when weighing any item.
1,Screen fluctuation,The product is handy but when it arrived it came with no battery. Moreover after few uses screen started to fluctuate very often. It became unusable.
1,Pathetic Products,"It wouldn‚Äôt work for suitcase over 10 kgs - the display start flickering and It does not deliver on what gets promised. Within one month of purchase, I had to discard the product. Stay away!"
1,Just when required its not working,"Play Video
 My whole money got in bin.. this is not done.
I will try my best that next time I should buy something like this from local market so that atleast i can reach to shop and claim."
1,product not working at all and seller will not return if you get defected one,"Product is not working and placed return request the next day and they have accepted after one month.. and now they cancelled the request to and now not able to place return request ‚Ä¶

Should I use the defected product‚Ä¶"
1,Problem metik, Not working
1,Scam!!!!!!!!,After single use the machine broke. The machine won't even read 15kgs correctly and shows error if you try to measure heavy weights.
1,"Wrost product, shows continuous error message",I bought this product considering it to be good moreover it is priced high but when i bought it and open it shows error code when i increase the weight beyond 10 kg and the weighing scale reading doesn't stop even after holding for 30 seconds. Won't recommend this product. I returned it.
1,Product doesn't work,"It doesn't work, its supposed to weigh bags upto 50kgs but shows error over 20kgs"
1,Device is not working,"Play Video
 Device is not working, I had used for weighing the luggage"
1,product is inaccurate and of law quality. Looks like the gotrippin had compromised with its quality.,"This product is very bad. Last year, I purchased the same product from go trippin still it is working good. On June, 2021, I ordered the same product from go trippin and found the product is inaccurate and of law quality. Looks like the gotrippin had compromised with its quality. Very sad."
1,The product is not working at all even after changing battery,For weighing the luggage bags
1,It has worked for a week after than giving faulty readings,Worst product
1,Very inaccurate readings,Worst design. We need to hold this up. That's the only option. Holding would not give accurate weight. It's very difficult to make it hang to a hook and measure weight. Also the readings are different when I'm lifting everytime.very bad
1,Used product,"Upon open the product the battery has been open already and the item box sticker has removed and replaced with normal tape , due the emergency I am not returning the product from next time please send new brand product not used product."
1,Product accuracy is not good . So not buy this. Company is cheated to customer,Product is not calculate in KG. Just we check a bag weight . then total weight show 175 kg which is wrong.
1,Not reliable,The reading for my suitcase in this device was 17kg whereas at airport it came out to be 25kg. That's a huge difference. The purpose for which I got this device is not served.
1,Don't buy ..... Very bad product,It's not working after few days .... Very bad product
1,Stopped working within an hour. Had to send it back,Working fine in the morning that I received it. Tried using it again later that day and wouldn't stay on for more than a second. Returned it
1,Faulty product,Was showing error and not working
1,Low qualitry product,"I purchased it in August 2021. Its not working now. It says warranty for 1 year. BUt there is no option to return it in Amazon.
Very low quality product. Its not working after a few usages."
1,"Worst product not having battery first, after put new battery it's always showing error","Worst product not having battery first, after put new battery it's always showing error"
1,Sub standard quality product,"Product was defective, it was showing Err most of the time, if it works then it was showing weight in negative."
1,"Will surely not recommend the product, waste of money",The product can be used to weight fruits vegetables or bags which weigh less than 17 kgs. If one try to weigh something above 20 kgs not only we see an err message but also it finds it hard to get back to original reading i.e. 0.000
1,Shows error on the first use,"It was the first time using it and it kept showing ""Err"" instead of the weight. It wasn't very heavy bags I was trying it for. Tried it for a small backpack and it showed the same results as well. Waste of money"
1,"Worked for 3 days, showed wrong weight, had to to pay excess baggage.","After few days it showed ""err"" message and then it kept showing 0kg. Despite trying remove the battery, it never got reset. Couldnt return as I had to travel next day. Had to pay excess baggage as it shows 2-3 kg less than the weight of the baggage."
1,A typical china made product!!!,"1. The battery that I received was actually a used one!! (Already half spent)
2. The product featured online nowhere mentioned it's ""made in china"", else I would have chosen better alternative!"
1,works initially but not after the date of return policy passed away this just shows err message,The short duration for return police and no guarantees for such a pricey product
1,Stopped working after a few attempts,After a few attempts of use the product started showing 'Err' on the display. The luggage is not even more than 15kg. I am travelling tomorrow and cannot even get a replacement for this product. Had high hopes seeing reviews but this has been useless for me.

Providing wheels for a bag is to transport somewhat heavy goods.But this one is useless for that purpose. This will damage within two trips. When I saw its image I thought a good product. But really hopeless! I lost money. So take care before you place order for this. I don't know why Amazon is dealing this priduct. They will lose their reputation if they deal this kind of products. So sorry to say this negative opinion. No other way. Customers should not be cheated. I don't want even to return. I will tolerate this. No other way!

Servs purpose of travel and meet need of space and storage, easy to carry. Not checked in rainy days about water resistance or replant.. But cloths looks to be fine to resist water. Internal lining cloth has to be better for durabilty, doubt about durability since it be in fold and open, easy to get wearout.

Updating after use of 6 months.

Providing wheels for a bag is to transport somewhat heavy goods.But this one is useless for that purpose. This will damage within two trips. When I saw its image I thought a good product. But really hopeless! I lost money. So take care before you place order for this. I don't know why Amazon is dealing this priduct. They will lose their reputation if they deal this kind of products. So sorry to say this negative opinion. No other way. Customers should not be cheated. I don't want even to return. I will tolerate this. No other way!

2,Cheap quality - You get what you paid for,"This 3 piece set is cheap, at about 8000 for 3, it's on the lower end of pricing.

However, having brought it, I would not recommend it to anyone in the market. Better to buy single piece from shops at around 6500.

The luggages look good, but you may not get the color you bought. I bought blue and got red.

The bags are flimsy. Apart from the polycarbonate material which is expected to have flexibility, the zipper is very low grade. The rubber lining above zipper is low quality. The inner lining is so thin and sheer that you can literally make out what's inside.

Oh, and on my recent travel, the big bag zip came undone partly when it came on the belt. It is that flimsy!

The wheels and handle seem sturdy though.

I consider it a lesson learned for 8000 rs. Hopefully you can learn at my expense."

5,Satisfied with the product,"This review is being posted after using the bag for almost 3 months now.
Look wise the bags are awesome. The colour and quality are as shown / mentioned and it really looks classy.
Have deducted 2 points for storage as the bag size is comparatively smaller than other company bags. The small one is too small and hardly a few outfits can fit in. But it is good for a 2 day travel. Similarly the medium and big ones are also comparatively small.
The bags have a plastic coating done to it due to which it is not scratced easily.
The quality and wheels are very good and hence even the big one is easily portable.
Also, got a very good deal on Amazon for this.
Allover, I am very much satisfied with the product."

Pros:
1. Light weight, weighs almost 1 KG less than other similarly suitcases, can help you when you are carrying more luggage in domestic flights
2. Unique design: sure to stand out from the rest of gray/blue/black bags. Almost no chance of your bag being picked up by anyone else!
3. Smooth wheels & extendable handle

Cons:
1. Feels flimsy: Though went throughout the trip whithout any mishap
2. No internal pocket
3. The zip lining looks like it can be easily cut through, if somebody really wants to do it."
4,"Lightweight, overall good .","I'm giving it 4 stars because the zipper inside was broken. At first glance the product seemed to be so lightweight and flexible soft type that I thought it might break or crack soon when I'm going to use it. However after putting luggage it was not bad. I recommend don't stuff it with too much luggage and make it very heavy. It is very good if you want it to be medium packed. The handle seemed to be ok but not over tough. Overall,not bad."

4,A Good Suitcase for regular Travellers,"The Suitcase is light and sturdy good for regular travellers and cabin luggage. However the packaging in which it is being shipped by the seller is very bad. No protective packaging was used only a simple plastic sheet (as shown in the picture) because of which the suitcase came with dirt marks and scratches. I needed this suitcase urgently so I did not return . Packaging needs lots of improvement from the seller,very bad packaging."

The handle is absolutely disaster, when you pull up (see the video). The bars are uneven and is difficult to open and close. I can't return this since i have to travel this week and return option is available only by 15th. Skybag is a reputed company and they claim the quality of the product, this is a failed product then. I'm even confused is this original product or duplicate."
3,Good one.,Colour is different from what they've posted. It's little red and kind of pink and red colour mixed. Packaging and Zip lock is good. It's a light weight trolley. Wheels are pretty good.
3,Product is but there some old scratches probably not caused during delivery by delivery partners.,I like the size.
3,Good,I am using it form 1 month. It is good
3,good,good
3,Handle of the briefcase,Handle is weak. Trembles while moving the briefcase
3,average,price according good
3,Not worthy,Light weight but quality not good.. In one journey handle is almost coming out. Very low grade materials used.. Overall ok ok item.
3,Skybag,Durable and good product worth the money
3,Handle too fragile,The extendable handle of the trolley seems too fragile. It broke after just one domestic flight journey where they may be handling the luggage a bit harshly.
3,Worst packaging and product is also ok ok,Not good
3,Good but not very good,
3,Pretty Average.,"Body was full of scratches, i blame the packaging. The cardboard used for packaging was more like brown stuck with glue.
Wheels are good and sturdy, quite spacious inside and handles are height appropriate.

No major flaw with the product, only if the packaging was better certain damages could have been avoided."
3,Bag me scratch h,Not much better
3,Good but weak,"Overall it's a good luggage bag but looks little weak, looks like an old baggage being sold for lesser amount"
3,Looking like a used one,There are scratches in the bottom and the backside of the trolley the red colour is very dull not like the pictures.
3,Not Scratch Resistance,This isnt totally scratch resistance. I received the bag with a scratch because of which the material around the scratch got chipped off.
3,Damage,"Play Video
 Wheel upper side damage"
3,Not Recommend At All,Quality is poor and easily scratch come on body. Go for another product.
3,Size and space is not sufficient,Space is not as expected. Size of the trolley is small as expected

3,Bag,"It's good but not good as this price.
Medium quality."

3,Average,Average product
3,Good,"Product is nice
But two small scratches on it"
3,Body is good but Zipper had problem in the second use itself.,Lightweight. Good
3,It weighs 3kgs.,"It's not light weight as marketed. Weighs 3 Kg and for those who travel by Flight the 15 kg limit for checkin is reduced by 3kgs of the suitcase weight. Also it doesn't expand and isn't flexible like many other poly carbonate cases are!!

Isn't scratch resistant as it should be. But overall does the job pretty well."
3,One wheel gone after 1 year use,One wheel damaged after 2 year use
3,Light but not strong,Product is loght weight but the material is too weak wont take load
3,Colour attractive,Good product
3,Combination is not 000.Inside zipper did not have the pull tab,"The initial combination was not '000'.It was 909 ,which was identified by me after a lot of hassle. One of the inside compartment zipper did not have the 'pull tab'. So it can be opened and closed , but its not very convenient to do so. Overall the delivered product was not perfect. So not very satisfied."
3,Skybag's Are Really A Good,Best Bag I like this capicity is good according size it's Original Bag . I will gifted to my brother they are very happy to get this. Value of money
3,Lightest and perhaps costlier.,"Best for travelling. Very light. Especially when you are a regular flight commuter.
But deliver was very, very poor. Too many scratches by Amazon delivery. Could improve. Packaging very poor. Came with no packaging, except for the transparent plastic cover on it. Dissatisfied with delivery."
3,Good,Average quality
3,Wheels are not steady. Very light.,"Play Video
 Too light product, it seems like not an original product of skybags, if it is than I'll say worst production of skybags. üôè I've bought this product (55CM) by 1799/- for me it's good. If you want to buy than try to buy when it's below 1800/-."
3,Product is average,"There was a black burnt spot on the suit case. Doesn't look like it's scratch resistant. There is a plastic sheet pasted on the suitcase with the design and it might get peeled off soon, would have liked without the sheet."
3,Average,Like
3,Great product and styling,"Great product and styling. But the product received had some printing errors. Maybe that's the reason they were giving it away for 3200. Will try to see if it can be replaced but time being short, will leave town in 5 days. Less hopeful."
3,The product has few scratches in the body. Not satisfied. Zip is not proper.,
3,"Overpriced,small size ,not sturdy",Size is quite small .

Chain inside the bag is broken.
Outside protective sheet was scratched and torn from many places."
3,Not SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE FROM AMAZON,Small scratches all over the body like the plastic filming is pulling off.. Really not satisfied for the bucks i spent on it !!
3,Good product apart from packing.,"Meterial is prone to scratches, you cannot lay it down horizontally on the floor because there are no bush on the horizontal bottom. And final thing is packing was really bad when it arrived, it was like how it is in the pictures I've uploaded, no box, no bubble wrap. Just a thin plastic protecting it from the world."
3,Found in damaged condition,Found bag with several scratches
3,Not exact red but ok colour...looking good, Many Scrach on the trolly...so plz next time careful.. but according to range ok type product 4799 only
3,Good light weight,Light weighted but not much scratch resistant. More sturdy material is needed
3,"The sides of that bag coating , the edges is damaged. I'm totally disappointed in courier department",It's spacious and lightweight and easy to carry with that four small tires
3,I received bags with 2 different colours where as I had ordered pair of red bags.,The red bag - 75 cm is already scratched when it was delivered.
3,Quality,The product looks a bit cheap. The quality of the material is used is very glossy and feels cheap
3,No Space inside trolley,Atleast 2 set clothes should be adjust but here 55 cm false
3,Return of the trolley,It is a damaged product. Inside sib attachment missing.
3,Good product but had lots of stains of some adhesive,"The product itself is very good. It is light weight, compact and looks cool. I have given it three stars because the product I received had lots of stains of some kind of adhesive which took an hour for me to remove. Proper quality assurance test should be conducted by the company/seller before dispatch."
3,Handel is too short,"Looks great.
Light weight.
Not scratchproof
Handel is too short (biggest issue)"
3,Not bad,Not so hard...feel like local trolley..only design is good

3,Average,Looks cool but outer layer of plastic film can get scratches easily.
3,Light weight.. Good for individual.,It is light weight.. Good for individual. But only problem is it is not scratch resistant..
3,Just satisfy as per price,Brand not satisfied the quality

3,"Okay product, not that great","Not so sturdy, you may check at store before online purchase, lookwise its cute"
3,Many scratches,Many scratches are in the trolley.
3,"Good in outer looks, but poor interior",Interior was not good.
2,Cheap quality - You get what you paid for,"This 3 piece set is cheap, at about 8000 for 3, it's on the lower end of pricing.

However, having brought it, I would not recommend it to anyone in the market. Better to buy single piece from shops at around 6500.

The luggages look good, but you may not get the color you bought. I bought blue and got red.

The bags are flimsy. Apart from the polycarbonate material which is expected to have flexibility, the zipper is very low grade. The rubber lining above zipper is low quality. The inner lining is so thin and sheer that you can literally make out what's inside.

Oh, and on my recent travel, the big bag zip came undone partly when it came on the belt. It is that flimsy!

The wheels and handle seem sturdy though.

I consider it a lesson learned for 8000 rs. Hopefully you can learn at my expense."
2,Poor quality product despite the good looks,Product looks great but the outer shell is very weak and bendable to pressure and might break during rough handling at airports and would not recommend if you travel a lot. The bag arrived with multiple minor scratches all over the body and most prominently on the logo and back handle area(pictures provided) but keeping it instead of refund/return as I'm in a hurry to travel.
2,Lock code,"I am unable to open the trolly bag, lock combination 000 is not helpful.

what can i do ???"
2,Lock is faulty,We struggled to unlock it as the lock wasn't working properly. We placed request for return of the product but the seller didn't visit for collecting the item even after fixing the date. There is no further response from Amazon
2,The suit case was damaged.,The Lock was broken & the box was bent.
2,Quality is not good,Thickness and strong esa is not that good.. we should handle very gently
2,Poor quality of wheels,It was unfortunate that the wheel broke on day 2 of purchase .
2,Damaged trolley bag,"I have received damaged trolley bag. Lamination plastic is torned and it has several scratches all over it. So, pls check the attached pictures and return this item."
2,Defected item delivered," Handle is not working properly,gets stuck halfway.It doesn‚Äôt go inside easily."

2,Bag not same as shown in the picture!!!,There is no side carry handle on lock side and no foot rest that are shown in the picture!!!
2,Very ordinary feel and material..Not recommended.,"Not even close to what was expected from a Brand like Skybags. Very ordinary material, the body doesn't feel strong enough to withstand drops as the ads claim, and the worst.. it came with a scratch on it already. Couldn't return though because I had to travel urgently, but very bad experience with this purchase."
2,Not a good quality product,"It already had scratches on it, looks local quality. Disappointed as i really liked the looks while ordering but not worth the money. Ordered for 4k."
2,Trolley not so good,
2,Defective,"Supplied defective piece,
Wheel level is not perfect"
2,"Small bag, good enough for 1 kid","1. Bag is smaller than expected. Size described on website is external size which includes wheels, handle and lock. 10% of Inside space is occupied by pull out handle, which makes it even smaller.

2. They sent bag without any packaging. Even the polythene provided by skybag was left open. Therefore bag got scratch marks in transit.

3. I ordered this bag for my 10 year old, and she is happy with it and refused to return. But I feel that it will hold very few things and very soon I will have to purchase bigger bag for her."
2,Size is too small,Very small in size . Pls replace the red colour & send me the blue colour or refund the money in my bank account. Thanks.....

2,Not as Expected!!!,"The large trolly was defective so I replaced it. But the replaced one too was defective and had lots of scratches, where it says it's material is scratch resistant.

1,"I recently purchased the Sky trolley bag from Amazon, and I must express my disappointment","I recently purchased the Sky trolley bag from Amazon, and I must express my disappointment with its quality. The overall construction feels subpar, and after only a short period of use, I've noticed signs of wear and tear.

The material seems to lack durability, and the stitching is already unraveling in certain areas. The wheels also don't roll smoothly, making it cumbersome to maneuver, especially in crowded spaces.

I expected better quality for the price, and I'm concerned about the bag's longevity. I hope Sky takes these issues into consideration for future improvements."

1,Poor quality of Zip link,In our second travel the zip link which moves the zip and then is inserted in the lock BROKE. The suitcase was properly handled by us and at the airport. This made the suitcase totally unsafe as it could be opened by anyone. A premium product which is unreliable to use. I checked the broken link and found it to be thin and flimsy.

This is horrendous service as after waiting for days I do not have any product to use nor have my money in hand too.

I returned and ordered it again for this color blue hunter but bad luck, same blackish colour received again, so returning it now will order some other wallet now.

Hope they correct the images in the catalogue.

2,Product colour is very different from the advertised product,"Packaging was very good and it was home delivered fast without any hassle. That's all the positive.
However similar or better quality products are available in local market at same price but that is still acceptable.
What is really disappointing is that the actual colour of the wallet has absolutely no resemblance with the product advertised. This is very misleading, but instead of going through the hassle of ordering a replacement if thats even possible, I decided to make my peace with it. The leather is hard and it is not as slim as I expected but maybe that will change over time. I hope the sellers will ensure better checking before shipping a product or atleast post accurate pictures that are at least indicative of the right colour and features."

2,"Little room for CCards, bulges","First of all the MRP and discount is a joke, no way it is of 1499. It is mostly available in lightning deals. It looks attractive from outside but has usability issues.
You cannot keep more than 2 credit cards as only 2 slots r there n 1 slot for license. So no use for me as I carry 6 cards.
Second big problem is the bulge it makes in pocket. It swells up with very little content. Overall, not a good deal."

5,Excellent Quality and Product,"I recently purchased this card holder, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. This compact accessory has made my life so much more organized.

The design is sleek and minimalist, which I love. It easily fits into my pocket without adding bulk. The quality of the materials used feels premium, and I can tell it's built to last.

One of the best features is its capacity. Despite its slim profile, it can hold a surprising number of cards, from credit cards and IDs to business cards. The slots are snug yet accessible, ensuring that my cards won't fall out accidentally.

The RFID-blocking technology is a great security feature, protecting my sensitive information from potential digital theft. It's a small detail that provides extra peace of mind.

Overall, I highly recommend this card holder. It combines style, functionality, and security into one compact package. It's made my everyday life more convenient, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase."

The currency pocket is not that great. Id card pocket out side is nice.

The material is very cheap looks as if plastic and not like PU.

Zip is sturdy and fancy. It is not leather so if your in that hope then forget it. It does not even come in a good quality package. Just a wrapper as we get better packaging from a street seller.
I dont recommend."

2,Misleading title. NO LEATHER parts whatsoever.,"I ordered this for Rs.600 by looking at the title and the design assuming it would have a leather (faux leather at least) top and would be durable. When I received it the next day (thanks Amazon for the quick delivery), I realized I've been taken for a ride. It looks great when it is brand new but definitely not one part of it is even faux leather. It is completely synthetic and plastic-like material.
Decided not to place a return/refund request due to personal reasons beyond the purview of this review."

2,"It must be priced between 180 to 230, Quality should be improved.","Play Video
 Quality of material is not good, price is high, Zipper quality is average, but design is good and looks stylish as a card holder."
2,Not a Value for Money Product,"Purchased ""9 slot storite card holder"" for Rs 599.
- A highly utility product, the 9 slots are very helpful for long term storage of our cards, PAN, multiple IDs etc.
- The three side zipper is boon, completely closes the wallet and ensure no card falls out by mistake.
- No doubt, very relevant item for life.
But the material of card holder is cheap and kind of un-attractive. Paying Rs 599 for this material is very high. Ideal price should 249/299.
I decide to keep it for the time being for want of anything better.
Thanks"

First impression on quality - Good
Will update about the quality after using."
4,Good,
2,The bag is ok,"The images showing the bag are deceiving. The bag in the image is stuffed so it seems like the cloth used in the bag will withstand it's shape. However, if you take a bottle and a cloth to the gym, this bag will look really bad on you.

I would request you to please invest 200 more and buy a good bag with a little thick fabric. This is just a piece of thin cloth attached to a strap.

You buy cheap, you buy twice."
3,Very small,Not as big as I expected

Things might not sit comfortably inside. But enough room to accomodate these things. I like it, it's very compact and fit and easy to carry around."
4,Little small but quality is good for this price,
4,Useful bag for carrying small but bulky items.,Just awesome.
5,Small in size but has its own benefits,"The measurements are exactly same. 13*8*6 (W x H x D) which I was looking for to dump smaller stuffs in a bag and keep it below the driver seat of my car. It has helped to make some space in the glove box and especially this is useful for Kia Carens where a good amount of space below driver seat can be utilised.

Of course this can't be used for gym or any other sports activities if we need to keep one litre bottle, pair of shoes, etc. But we can make use of this for other purposes for sure and good quality product."
4,Goodd,Goood
4,Go for it...,Dimensions r length around 35 CM height around 15 CM breath around 20 CM you can't place a volume or football in this it is a small and compact bag Good for gym you can easily place shoes and your towel your t shirt and bottle
5,Best in this cost!!!,"I just got it by yesterday (14-05-23), it was delivered a day before I was expecting. It's a very fine product I got in this price and the space is enough for the shoes,sport belt,gloves,phone,earpods&bottle. It even contain a pocket (beside).

Also, the finish is very poor, do not recommend.

And the eyemask, that is also a very narrow strip, which leaves a gap around your nose for light to come in. Again, defeating the purpose of putting an eye mask on."

1,This Neck pillow is not Durable. Please dont buy it.,"My recent purchase of the Billebon Premium Neck Pillow Eye Mask Combo has left me disappointed. This product, which seemed promising at first, fell far short of my expectations and failed to deliver on several fronts.

To begin with, the quality of both the neck pillow and eye mask is underwhelming. The materials used feel cheap and flimsy, lacking the durability necessary for long-lasting use. Within a short period of time, I noticed signs of wear and tear, including fraying seams and loose threads. It's disheartening to invest in a product that starts to deteriorate so quickly.

The comfort provided by the neck pillow is also questionable. Despite its plush appearance, it lacks proper support and fails to provide the necessary cushioning for a restful journey. The memory foam, advertised as a premium feature, lacks density and quickly loses its shape. It simply does not live up to the expectations of a comfortable travel pillow.

Furthermore, the combo's portability is compromised due to its bulkiness. The neck pillow takes up a significant amount of space in a bag, making it inconvenient for travel. It would have been more desirable to have a compact and easily packable option, but unfortunately, this combo fails to provide that."
1,not satisfied,"1. I clearly remember when I ordered, it was mentioned that the pillow would come along with an eye mask! Only a pillow got delivered. If you start changing order details, that is a pathetic treatment!
2. The quality is extremely poor though soft. It will not last at all."
1,Too bad,"Product was not soft, its hard and I faced severe neck pain using this for just for 15 minutes on my journey from Visakhapatnam to Singapore. It pained alot,So I had to remove it and keep it away . Upon reaching singapore airport I thrown it in dustbin as its useless and not worthy even to carry with me.I do not recommend any one to use unless he/she wants neck pain for free,"
1,Worst product,1st time I get an used product and I replace the same product. After that i received worst quality and size of the product also reduced.

You will have to use the 1100 GSM Microfiber Drying Towel for drying a whole car.

 My second purchase from ShineXPro

Pro's
1) Softest microfiber cloth I have ever used. Will help in ensuring your car doesn't get scratched
2) Extra Large, 1 cloth is almost equal to 2 microfibers size of other brands. It also dries the car really easily
3) Border is also very soft and has a loop at the end to dry the cloth

Con's
1) Not easy to maintain if you are giving this cloth to your cleaner, please inform them to not dry this in direct sunlight as doing so will make the cloth hard. Otherwise you have to change the cloth every 3-4 months. You also cannot use this cloth for doing shampoo wash. This cloth is just for drying the car after wash
2) Two cloths needed to dry the entire SUV, so works out to be a little expensive"
5,Great Absorbency and easy to clean,"Have been using it for quite sometime now and its very good to clean my car, absorbs the water and cleans the car without much pressure being applied.

4,Nice product at this price,Nice product at this price
4,Amazing.,Superb.
3,Fantastic cloth,very useful product to wash the car . good product must try to buy this
3,500 GSM not good for absorbing,I got exactly what has been specified. However wiping & absorbing is properly done by 800 GSM towels.
3,Not upto the mark,After using for 2 month... Not even cleans properly.. Leaves mark on surface.... Not upto the mark. Much high price...
3,Good for cleaning car interiors and windows,"A promising microfiber cloth for wiping glasses/windows and interior of cars and also doesn't leave lint hanging around like mediocre microfiber cloth, as far as it goes with the water absorbing capabilities, it is not as effective as the product has been led to believe, It has decent capacity to wipe off small amount of water but if you are expecting to dry off the whole car with this then forget it !

You will have to use the 1100 GSM Microfiber Drying Towel for drying a whole car.

All in all it is a decent product and totally worth the cost compared to the other microfiber cloth in the market, it would not be wrong to conclude that it can compete with best products in this arena."
3,Expensive,Good one but found a bit expensive
3,Shine‚ÇπPro,"It's not really worth the hype. But better than the average cheap microfiber cloth found on Amazon. Anyone thinking it'll wipe like in the ad, will be in for a big disappointment TBH... Kudos to whoever made the ad. 3rd star is just for you"
3,It‚Äôs good quality product,It‚Äôs works as expected.
3,Size is not expected what it showed in description,Expected thick & more big in size
3,Nice but do not expect to be highly water absorbent,I didn‚Äôt feel like its that much water absorbent as said in the ad or video. Its just a normal extra soft microfibre cloth.
3,Not much difference for dry wipe and not cleaning dust properly,Dust are not going off with this clothes wipping
3,Nice product.,Value for money. And extra soft. Durable too.
3,It‚Äôs ok,"Play Video
 It doesn‚Äôt absord a lot of water and keeps getting wet for small use. After couple of uses it started leaving stains after wipe. As there are 2 of them I‚Äôm using both one after the ither for single car wash. I even left the car out for 15 mins after then tried to wipe, still the same."
3,Good one with short life,"It‚Äôs water absorbing capacity lasts only for 3 to 4 washes, after that it‚Äôs normal cloth, even a normal cloth dries better than this after 4 washes."
3,Good,Good
3,Poor quality," It's quality is very poor though it's as per dimensions mentioned.
I used it for washing my car."
3,Oküëç,üëç
3,These are really good product.,"The size should be little bigger. With this price, bigger sized cleaning clothes are easily available."
3,Good,Good product
3,Just received,Let's use it then I shall give my comment. The measurements are correct as declared.
3,Average product,"I bought this after seeing the ads and hence is a total disappointment.
It absorbs the water as shown in the ads only during the first time and looses its property after just one wash.
This still is better than an ordinary kitchen towel but not worth the price. We can get similar if not better quality microfiber clothes for the same price or even less."
3,Quite ok,"As per the price range product is ok
Not worth of this much money...
V good in water absorption and quality of cloth...
But v expensive"
3,Okay,"Quality of cloth is good, but after 7-8 washes the water absorption of cloth is less"
3,Over Hype,Not much good as mentioned and shown in videos just an ordinary cloth with soft fibres suitable for car cleaning
3,Average product,Not as good as shown in video. Water suction is not as shown in pics and video. But overall average.
3,First 10 wash was great,"the softness of material will be gone after few washes, due to that it will not soak the water. I have 2 pairs of cloths and both of them has same issue."
3,Absorption level is not satisfactory,Water absorption ability is not satisfactory
3,Not up to the mark,Product is entirely different in performance as showcased in the product video .I am not sure about the GSM capacity mentioned in the product specification. Water soaking is not proper and quality is equivalent with a simple economical fibre cloth purchased from local market with only Rs 45/-.
3,Average product,"Price high side
Could improve the quality"
3,Good product but price wise expensive,Fiber clothes are good but price not a justify.
3,Doesn‚Äôt work as shown in the video,This is not as soft as looks in the video. They might have reduced the quality after selling a receiving good feedbacks.
3,Misleading Advertisement!,The advertisement is misleading. The clothe doesn't absorb the water completely and leaves some droplets and marks on the surface. You cant use a dry cloth on the car to remove the dust. It is very expensive for the utility that it holds. Overall not a value for money. Don't wate your money on this product.
3,"Quality is good, expensive according to the price.",Doesn't absorb the water like it should absorb.
3,avarage product,avarage
3,Okay,Not so good as they cliam in the video but okay
3,Not worth the price,It does not feel like a 500GSM cloth. The water absorbency and retention is average.
3,Ok product,It's a little big in size. Water absorption is not as expected.
3,Average Quality,Quality is not upto the mark. Not that much soft.
3,Not worth for the price. Just a brand name.,Water absorbing capacity reduce after washing. GSM is very less compared to similar brands which is even half price. I just bought because of brand name but i dont feel it worth
3,Overpriced product,The product quality may be good. However it is highly overpriced & there is no worth of paying double the cost.
3,Wiping water issues,Product is not good in wiping water it does not able to observe water
3,good,good
3,Become hard after few wash,"Cloth become harder after using of few days, makes scratches on car ."
3,Ok,After cleaning there need twice rubbing
3,Ok,Not same as see in video
3,Not a special cloth,Cloth is really good... But as per the given video its not cleaning the water completely... It is also like othe micro fiber cloths
3,Quality,Not as expected as described in the product details
3,Good,Product is kind of good but absorbency is not as advertised.
3,Soaks up water quite well,"All positive things about this drying towel, but the thing that compelled me to give 3 stars instead of 5 , is the messy Lint this towel leaves on the surface that you get irritated badly.from day one i had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised with the amount of water it soaked. Just amazing. Then comes the spoiler, Lint. I thought the problem would go after a couple of washes, but even after using it a dozen of times the problem remains. To sum it up, Amazon basics/Meguiars drying towels are still the best in business."
3,Actual size of cloth is small as compare to advertisement.,"Actual size of cloth is small as compare to advertisement.
Disappointed with size of cloth"
3,Not so effective clean,First two clean it observe very well but after 3 wash it's like normal cloth.
3,its not as shown in advertisement,"its not that absorbent as shown in youtube or advertisement ,but ha its decent one but it wont absorb 100% water as they show let say it will absorb 60% of water and u have to clean again twice to get it dry"
3,Average,Thickness is not good. Costly according to quality and size
3,Over marketed over priced,Its a good pair of soft micro fibre clothes with good density. However its no magic water absorbent piece of cloth as promoted in there advertisement all over internet thus disappointing and does not justify the price of almost Rs 300 for a single piece. You can as well opt for any thick micro fibre from welspun etc brands where you get better deal.
3,Nothing special,Product is not extraordinary in any way. Cheaper micro fiber cloth can do the same thing. It is large in dimensions though. Big positive.
3,Good Product! but not absorbing water like the video.,"Good Product! but not absorbing water like the video, But better than other micro fiber cloths."
3,Good,"It is good but higher gsm is better than this one .
I have many cloths of different gsm for my car .
But higher gsm is best always ."
3,Not as showing in ad,Waste of min
3,Just within one month of usage the cloth lost all its microfibre,Not value for money product
3,Faltu,Normal jaisa hi he market me 100 ke asspass milta same waise hi he
3,Not that great,"Even though the cloth is too soft, it doesn't actually remove little hard strains on car surface."
3,Overpriced,Product is good but overpriced.
3,Quality is very low,Quality is very low
3,Good product,"Not dislike and not very impressed.

2,Material,This cloth is good only for 2 wash after which the cloth becomes like few year used towel. The length of the cloth is fine. But the material is not good
2,Quality,Product quality should be more bettter
2,Not Lint Free,"It claims to be lint free. I used it to apply rain repellent but it left lint on the glass which is not getting removed as it got mixed with the chemical.

My worst experience due to company‚Äôs false claim.

Additionally, do not buy SinexPro glass cleaner. It makes glass worst looking by leaving marks."
2,Not worth buying,The cloth is not worth buying. The micro fiber cloth by softspun is much better
2,Useful,Normal quality
2,Product is overpriced. Quality is not that good as shown.,"Product is overpriced.
Quality is not that good as shown. Also small lint like particles are falling out of it."
2,Average,Not satisfied with cleaning
2,Lasted two washes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,Out of the box they were great and absorbed water really well and worked like a good microfiber. Two washes later (mind you I followed the care instructions on the package exactly) and they have lost their softness and a great deal of the absorbency and now leave streaks on the car. Very disappointed with the quality as these were not cheap and ShineX are trying to portray these as a premium quality product.
2,Not Effective,The product is not as effective as shown in the video. The car surface doesn't get dry as shown in the video.The water absorption by the product is not as shown in video. The video is misleading . The false advertisement should be reported to consumer forum for misleading public
2,Water wash cloth,It seems like normal clothe but adds exaggerated about the product
2,Not satisfiedüòí,"The ads and reality has a big difference,
I am not satisfied for cleaning my car with this cloth, (wet Or Dry)
yes the material and the quality is soft and good but does do the cleaning as shown in their promotion videos.. üòû"

2,Not worth,Dislike

2,Not that good as shown in the video,It does not soke water very well. ok product.
2,Long and short,I liked the length but the width is too small
2,Not really good for cleaning water from car,"The product is not at all as advertised.. missed the return slot or would surely have returned.
One wash and the cloth became very thin and not absorbing water as much."
2,Not as described/ shown,"it will not wipes out Water in single Stoke as shown in videos , you have yo wipe couple of times to dry the place just like a normal clothes!"
2,Not up to expectation,The Ad they are showing in the video is not in the reality.
2,The fabric is too thin,"The fabric as it appears in the picture and video, isn't that thick it's too thin"
2,Not much usefulness,Just to clean the car interior only
2,The absorption just goes of in 4 or 5 washes.,The 1st 4 or 5 washes are making up to the claim. But then later it just becomes a normal nano fiber cloth that we purchase for a cheaper cost. So for 4 or 5 washes are you ready to spend that much money is your choice.

1,If you READ THIS DONT BUY this product.,"If you read this please do not waste your money on this product, it has no water adsorption just spreads water around leaving streaks all around, its almost as you wipe with a cotton cloth, and left too much lint after wipeing.
I previously used from a different company called SOFTSPUN and was way better than this for probably less cost, could have lasted long too if i had not washed it in the washing machine mixed with cloths that i used for polishing the car and it caught all the lint from the machine as well.
A tip : dont wash your microfiber cloth in a washing machine it will collect all the lint and it really tough to remove it."
1,Very poor quality of micro fiber after 1st wash,"Play Video
 A new piece will feel niece but after one wash only the quality deteriorates. I bought a microfiber from market for 200 and its microfiber is still intact after many wash. Please avoid this product.

 Honest Review
It is normal as an ordinary cloth that old school car washer use for car wash. The ordinary cloth cost Rs. 30 INR and can easily be used for 3-4 months and even more at times. Infact Dmart offers a microfibre cloth at Rs. 49 INR and with the same result. It's not a good absorbent though as claimed and does not serve the purpose. That's why it's just a hype for the so called sophisticated people and not the value for money."
1,Bakwaas,Very bad product bulky and only bulky
1,Waste of money ....fake promises... Not recommended,"I don't how much fake reviews are here on this website and how much has-been paid by the company and amazon to the people to give a fake review....
I have used other microfiber items as well but this is not any good I will say ..the water absorbing power is almost nothing.. For a reference you can say the general cotton cloth or a normal towel will be equal to this so called 500 rupees cloth.... The softness is good but the absorbing and cleaning power is absolutely nothing as shown in the video by the fake audience who I think reviewed it for money..... So if you want to buy a microfiber towel you can get it for 200 rupees and no need to spend 500 rupees on this overhyped thing... Not recommended at all... Complete waste of money energy and time
